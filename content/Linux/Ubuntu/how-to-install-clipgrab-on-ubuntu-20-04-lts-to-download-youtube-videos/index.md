## Install ffmpeg

To convert and download 1080p videos from YouTube with ClipGrab, you need to instal either ffmpeg or avconv. So, we're going to instal ffmpeg by typing the command apt-get instal ffmpeg, as shown below. If you try to open ClipGrab without installing ffmpeg or avconv, you will get a message that says no installed version of avconv or ffmpeg could be found.

```
apt-get install ffmpeg
```

## Download ClipGrab

Since it's open source, you can compile the source code or use the pre-compiled version. Here, we'll use a pre-compiled package. You can download ClipGrab's newest pre-compiled version for Linux via wget. This downloads the current package.

```
wget https://download.clipgrab.org/ClipGrab-3.9.7-x86_64.AppImage
```

```
chmod +x ClipGrab-3.9.7-x86_64.AppImage
