Cloud migration is the procedure of transferring current applications and data from on-premise data centers to cloud infrastructure. Cloud migration has grown as more and more companies realize their digital transformation goals. This method provides a broad range of customized services to meet the unique needs of different applications, such as PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS.

## **What is the correlation between DevOps and SRE teams**

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) collaborates closely with Development and Operations (DevOps) by offering a comprehensive framework of procedures, guidelines, and automated protocols for DevOps teams to efficiently oversee updates and promptly address system complications in complex, geographically dispersed systems.

DevOps seeks to achieve a delicate equilibrium between speed and stability, while SRE emphasizes reliability. Both approaches place importance on metrics, but DevOps takes into account factors such as deployment frequency, cycle time, and change fail rates. At the same time, SRE focuses on managing service level agreements (SLAs), service level objectives (SLOs), and service level indicators (SLIs) by utilizing error budgets. While there are distinct differences between DevOps and SRE, they should not be viewed as competing solutions. **Instead,** they can **do specific** work **for** the overall success of the company.

## **What are the benefits of combining SRE and DevOps?**

DevOps and SRE must work together to accelerate software delivery, break organizational boundaries, and simplify operations. In today's ever-evolving landscape, where user demands continue to escalate and competition relentlessly progresses, system crashes are unacceptable. Therefore, in order to maximize productivity and deliver great service, firms need to combine their DevOps and SRE teams.

## **What are the challenges addressed by DevOps teams and SREs**

Implementing DevOps comes with its own set of challenges and risks. These include cultural resistance to change, insufficient communication and collaboration between teams, lack of standardization and automation, potential security and compliance risks, and difficulties in effectively measuring success.

An SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) plays a crucial role in contributing to a business by utilizing automation to eliminate and alter unnecessary tasks and positions. This helps to minimize overall expenses through resource optimization and enhancing the mean time to repair (MTTR).
