Let's take a closer look at the reasons behind **Utho's** rebranding and the journey behind it.

_**Why was the name changed to Utho?**_

## **A Mother's Wake-Up Call**

Take a moment to recall those precious childhood memories when your mother's gentle voice nudged you out of bed. Her words had the power to awaken your senses and prepare you for the day ahead. **"Utho, school jana hai" (Get up, it's time to go to school)** were not just ordinary words; they held the magic of motivation and served as a reminder that we all have a purpose to fulfill.

“Our mother's unwavering support has always been our driving force. She believes in us, inspires confidence, and reminds us that obstacles are only opportunities to grow.”

## **The Deep Meaning of UTHO**

**UTHO** holds a deep meaning for all of us as it represents the times when we faced the toughest challenges in our life. It is a voice from our hearts and says, **"UTHO, kaam par lag jao"** (Rise up and get to work). It became a call to action, igniting our determination and propelling us forward.
