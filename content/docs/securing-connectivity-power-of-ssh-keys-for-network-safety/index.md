Enterprises universally depend on Secure Shell (SSH) keys for authenticating privileged users and ensuring trusted access to vital systems like application servers, routers, firewalls, virtual machines, cloud instances, and various devices. Not solely restricted to privileged administrative operations, It play a pivotal role in secure machine-to-machine automation for critical business functions. Once established for client authentication, facilitate seamless, password-free, and automated connections between systems.  

## **What is a Secure Shell ?**  

An SSH key is a secure access credential for the SSH (secure shell) network protocol. This authenticated and encrypted protocol is utilized for remote communication between machines on an unsecured open network. SSH serves as a secure solution for remote file transfer, network management, and remote operating system access. The term "SSH" also refers to a collection of tools designed for interaction with the SSH protocol.  

## **What is the functioning mechanism of SSH key authentication?**  

It consist of a public-private pair. The public key is publicly available, whereas the private key remains confidential. The public key encrypts data, and only the corresponding private key can decrypt it. This ensures that only the owner, holding the private key, can access the information. Even if a third party intercepts the public key, forging a connection is impossible without the private key.  

## **How can SSH Keys be utilized?**  

The company utilizes an SSH key for secure online authentication and communication. This provides users with easy access, bypassing the complexities associated with traditional operations.  

- Ensuring secure communication between local computers and remote hosts enables the establishment of connections and the issuance of necessary commands.  
    

- Safely perform tasks like updates, backups, software installations, system repairs, and other remote administration operations.  
    

- SSH establishes a secure, automated connection with the server for performing operations such as making adjustments, uploading files, creating backups, changing configurations, and more.  
    

- The SSH key provides access without passwords for two or more user accounts through a single sign-on.  
    

## **What advantages does SSH key authentication offer compared to password authentication?**  

SSH key authentication offers various benefits compared to using passwords.  

- **Highly secure authentication method:** For businesses with sensitive data, using SSH keys for [SFTP](https://www.precisely.com/glossary/sftp#:~:text=SFTP%2C%20or%20Secure%20File%20Transfer,it%20travels%20between%20different%20systems.) servers adds strong security. The keys can be extremely long, making them highly resistant to hacking, equivalent to a password with at least 12 uncommon characters.  
    

- **Mitigates vulnerabilities associated with passwords:** Traditional passwords, often easy to guess or reused, pose security risks. SSH-keys, automatically generated and unique, eliminate these vulnerabilities.  
    

- **Guarantees the use of only authorized devices:** Logging in with usernames and passwords allows access from any device, even insecure ones. [SSH-keys](https://utho.com/ssh-key), on the other hand, only permit access from approved devices with stored keys, preventing unauthorized use.  
    

- **Keeps things secure during an attack:** Even with your best efforts, data breaches can happen. If you use passwords and the server is compromised, hackers can steal the password. By disabling passwords and requiring SSH keys, even during a hack attempt, the attacker won't be able to access the user account.  
    

## **What sets Utho apart in terms?**  

At Utho, we've streamlined the process, eliminating the complexity of setting up the Public through the Command Line Interface. Now, you can effortlessly assign your Public SSH key directly from the Cloud Console.
