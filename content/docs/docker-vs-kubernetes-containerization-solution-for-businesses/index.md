This can pose challenges in environments where developers need to integrate more than one container.  
  
**Lack of persistence:** Detractors may highlight that Docker's notable portability and modularity occasionally result in challenges with persistent storage. Without setting up volumes for data storage in the Docker Engine, containerization completing its assigned process will shut down, rendering all processed data inaccessible. Presently, there is no automated process in place to address this issue.  
  
**CLI reliance:** Docker operations heavily depend on proficiency in command-line interface (CLI) usage, and the framework is designed for applications that primarily function with terminal commands. This may pose challenges for users working with applications that demand a graphical user interface (GUI).  

## **What are the use cases for Docker containerization?**  

Docker finds diverse applications across various scenarios, including:  
  
**Microservices:** Docker enables the breakdown of applications into smaller, manageable components, facilitating the deployment and development of architectures based on microservices.  
  
**DevOps Adoption:** Docker streamlines the software delivery process by fostering the adoption of DevOps principles within organizations. This is achieved by promoting collaboration between operations and development teams.

**Continuous Deployment:** Continuous delivery and integration become easily achievable with Docker, as it facilitates automated and swift deployment of applications.
