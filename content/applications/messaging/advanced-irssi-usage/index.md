Irssi is a popular IRC client known for its flexible plugin system and built-in Perl interpreter. With customization options, you can enhance your Irssi experience. This guide will walk you through some of the most valuable features, plugins, and tweaks to optimize your Irssi setup.

Before diving in, it's assumed that you're comfortable with basic Irssi commands and usage. If you need a refresher or guidance on installing Irssi, refer to our [Using Irssi for Internet Chat](/docs/guides/using-irssi-for-internet-relay-chat/) guide.

## Key Bindings and Aliases

To streamline your workflow, you can assign frequently used commands to key bindings. For instance, this command binds /window last to `Alt-x` or `Esc-x`:

    /bind meta-x /window last

This command sets up a shortcut key for meta-x, which can be triggered by pressing `Alt-x` or `Esc-x`, depending on your terminal setup. When you press `Alt-m-x`, it'll execute the command /window last in your Irssi session. This action switches the focus between your two most recent chat windows. If you want to assign shortcuts using Control- combinations, you can use `^X` or `^v`, where X and v represent the keys you want to bind (`C-X` or `C-v` in emacs-style notation).

Note: Remember that key bindings in Irssi are case-sensitive.

Alternatively, you may want to create an **alias**:

    /alias wj join -window
    /alias wm window move

Once you've set up these aliases, instead of typing `/window join #channel`, you can use `/wj` #channel to join a channel in the current window. Similarly, instead of `/window move [number]`, you can type `/wm` to relocate the window.

You can also create aliases with variables. Irssi doesn't forward unrecognized commands to the IRC server, resulting in an unknown command error when using commands like `/cs` or `/ns`. To resolve this, add the following aliases:

    /alias cs quote cs $0-
    /alias ns quote ns $0-

When you use `/cs` or `/ns`, it functions as if you had typed `/msg chanserv` or /`msg nickserv`, respectively. The `$0`- variable in the aliases forwards anything after /cs or /ns to the service you're attempting to use (ChanServ or NickServ).

## Save State

If you don't save your configuration explicitly, any changes made to your Irssi session will be lost when you exit Irssi. To avoid this, you can save all current configuration modifications to your `~/.irssi/config` file:

       /save

You might also want to run `/layout save` to preserve the arrangement of windows. This way, when you start Irssi again, you won't have to rearrange all the channels you've set to automatically join.

Moreover, consider creating the `ADDALLCHAN` alias to save all your current channels:

    /alias ADDALLCHAN script exec foreach my \$channel (Irssi::channels()) { Irssi::command("channel add -auto \$channel->{name} \$channel->{server}->{tag} \$channel->{key}")\;}

The `/ADDALLCHAN` command saves all currently joined channels and automatically joins them the next time you run Irssi.

## Use Plugins

Irssi offers various plugins. You can explore the [Irssi script repository](http://scripts.irssi.org/) to find scripts. Use the following commands to manage scripts:

`/script` - Shows a list of all loaded scripts along with their full paths.
`/script load [script]` - Loads the specified script. Scripts are expected to be in the `~/.irssi/scripts/` directory. If a script is stored in a subdirectory of `~/.irssi/scripts/`.

you need to specify it in the load command. Scripts in ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/ are loaded when Irssi starts.
`/script unload [script]` - Unloads the specified script.
`/script exec [script]` - Executes the specified script once.
`/script reset` - Unloads all scripts and resets the Perl interpreter.

Here are some popular plugins among the Utho community:

- [trackbar.pl](http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/trackbar.pl) Generates a horizontal rule in a channel to mark the last time you viewed the channel's window.
- [go.pl](http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/go.pl) Provides advanced completion for accessing windows with a /go command that offers tab completion for all windows, and can even complete based on character combinations from the middle of the channel or private message names.
- [nickcolor.pl](http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/nickcolor.pl) Colorizes the nicknames of all members of a channel based on activity and join time to make the flow of conversation easier to read.
- [screen_away.pl](http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/screen_away.pl) Automatically detects if your Irssi session resides within an attached or detached screen session. If your screen session is detached, this plugin sets your status to away. When you reattach to the session, the plugin unsets the away status.
- [highlite.pl](http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/highlite.pl) Collects in one window all channel events like joins, parts, and quits.

You can install all of these scripts to run automatically when you start Irssi.

    cd ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/
    wget http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/trackbar.pl
    wget http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/go.pl
    wget http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/nickcolor.pl
    wget http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/screen_away.pl
    wget http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/highlite.pl

From within Irssi, load these plugins:

    /script load autorun/trackbar.pl
    /script load autorun/go.pl
    /script load autorun/nickcolor.pl
    /script load autorun/screen_away.pl
    /script load autorun/highlite.pl

To install but not auto-load the scripts, use `cd ~/.irssi/scripts/` before starting your wget commands. They'll end up in the main `scripts` directory, not the `autorun` directory. To load these scripts in Irssi:

    /script load trackbar.pl
    /script load go.pl
    /script load nickcolor.pl
    /script load screen_away.pl
    /script load highlite.pl
