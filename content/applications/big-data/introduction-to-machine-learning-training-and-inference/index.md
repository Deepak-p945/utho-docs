Machine learning (ML) dates back to 1959, when it was conceptualized as a way to enable computers to learn without explicit programming. For instance, an IBM researcher developed a self-learning program for playing Checkers.

ML is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computer algorithms to enhance their performance automatically by learning from data and experience.

In machine learning, algorithms use sample data, called training data, to construct a model. This allows the algorithms to identify patterns, relationships, and confidence levels. Machine learning finds applications in various fields like image recognition, detecting abnormal computer and network behaviors, and identifying spam messages.

## Understanding Training and Inference in ML
### Training

The training phase involves creating machine learning algorithms, where the ML system analyzes extensive datasets to understand a particular scenario. This process utilizes deep-learning frameworks like [Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), or [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/).

Training is a binary process - it's either a yes or a no. For instance, when training a model to recognize images of cars, the goal is to determine whether an image contains a car or not. The training process teaches the system to identify car features like tires, headlights, doors, and windows.

There exist four types of learning models: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement. The choice of which learning model to use depends on the specific goals your team is aiming to achieve.

- **Supervised learning**: This method requires labeled or categorized input data. It allows the algorithm to learn the correct answers when making predictions. It's the most common approach in ML.

- **Semi-Supervised**: This model uses a small amount of labeled data alongside unlabeled data. It proves useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive. The small labeled dataset helps the model categorize the unlabeled data.

- **Unsupervised learning:** In this model, the dataset is unlabeled. The algorithm seeks to uncover hidden patterns or groupings within the data without human intervention. It's more exploratory, aiming to identify similarities and differences in the information.

- **Reinforcement learning**: This method uses trial and error to produce output based on maximizing efficiency. The system analyzes generated output to find errors and provide feedback, which is used to improve performance. It's commonly used in deep learning, a subcategory of ML.

### Inference

After training a machine learning model, the next step is machine learning inference. In this phase, the trained models are applied to new data to draw conclusions. For instance, a developer or data scientist might provide the trained ML models with photos of cars it hasn't encountered before to see what conclusions it can draw based on its previous learning.

## Machine Learning: Cloud versus On-Premises
Training and inference have different processing requirements. Training needs powerful processors like high-end server CPUs and GPUs, while inference can often be done on devices like mobile phones. For example, Instagram filters that change a person's appearance recognize facial features and suggest changes right on the phone.

When it comes to training, systems often use tens or even hundreds of millions of data examples. So, the question is where to store all this data. If the data is already on-premises, it's usually best to process it there instead of uploading it to a cloud service provider (CSP).

One strong argument for on-premises data storage is data sensitivity. Regulatory compliance is a major reason to keep data on-prem. For instance, dealing with customer financial data is highly regulated, and sometimes not permitted to be moved to the cloud.

However, as cloud services expand, more data is being acquired and stored there. If a company already has data stored in the cloud, it might not make sense to download it on-premises. But if the data in the cloud matches on-premises data sets, you can download it once and then leave it in the cloud.

If a company suddenly needs or acquires petabytes of data, setting up on-premises storage can take weeks. With the cloud, you can request more capacity and have it in minutes.

Cloud storage for machine learning data has many benefits. The main advantage of cloud-based ML training is scalability on demand. This means you can scale up or down as needed, quickly and easily.

- **Flexible Resource Allocation**: The cloud is perfect for occasional or seasonal hardware needs. AI training hardware can be super expensive, costing millions of dollars. If you only need it now and then, you'll end up with a big investment sitting idle most of the time.

- **Access to the Latest Hardware**: Cloud service providers regularly get and set up the latest hardware. But budget constraints might mean you can't upgrade your AI hardware on-site as frequently as a CSP can.

- **Decoupled Architecture Tied to Specific Hardware**: When a company upgrades its on-prem hardware, it often needs to rewrite its software too. But with cloud-based training, there's a layer of abstraction from the hardware. So, when the hardware gets upgraded, the training algorithms might not need a rewrite.

Machine learning training heavily relies on GPUs for efficient processing, but this comes with a hefty price tag and significant energy consumption. If your training needs are occasional, opting for cloud-based training makes more financial sense. Investing in expensive GPU servers that you'll only use a few times a year isn't practical. Instead, leverage cloud resources for training and utilize the generated models either in the cloud or on your own premises.

## Best Practices for Cloud-Based Machine Learning
When to Opt for Cloud-Based Machine Learning Training: If your data resides in the cloud and your machine learning training is sporadic enough that using a cloud service provider is more cost-effective than investing in hardware. Here are some extra tips to consider:

- Choose a cloud service provider (CSP) that prioritizes data privacy and regulatory compliance aligned with your business needs.
- Ensure your data is stored and processed in the same cloud data center to optimize performance.
- Use machine learning platforms that abstract hardware complexities from data scientists, allowing them to focus on model development.
- Regularly update your machine learning models and computational programs to enhance efficiency and accuracy.
- Optimize computation by using frameworks that support lower precision calculations (e.g., 32-bit or 16-bit) when applicable, reducing processing time and costs.
- Consider a hybrid approach, utilizing on-premises hardware for initial experimentation before scaling up to the cloud to manage costs effectively.
