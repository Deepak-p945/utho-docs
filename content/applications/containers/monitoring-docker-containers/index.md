Eight years ago, containers were a niche technology with limited adoption. Then, Solomon Hykes introduced Docker, revolutionizing container technology and vastly simplifying its use. Today, containers dominate the IT landscape. According to Gartner, 70% of organizations are expected to run containerized applications by 2023.

Why the widespread adoption? Organizations recognize the benefits of simplified configuration, accelerated deployment, and efficient resource utilization offered by containerized applications.

Effective monitoring of Docker containers is essential to fully leverage these advantages. Without monitoring, you operate blindly, lacking visibility into container performance, behavior, and operational efficiency. Additionally, monitoring Docker containers is crucial for understanding the status and performance of microservices and applications built on containerized infrastructure. It provides insights into both container health and the overall functionality of user-facing services.

## Docker Container Monitoring: The Basics

Containers are highly favored because they seamlessly integrate with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), a pivotal DevOps methodology enabling developers to regularly integrate code into a shared repository. Once integrated, containerized applications deploy swiftly and efficiently.

Docker also empowers developers to encapsulate, distribute, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container, capable of operating across diverse environments. Containers ensure instant application portability.

By isolating code within individual containers, developers streamline program modifications and updates, enhancing efficiency. Enterprises leverage containers to break down extensive development projects across multiple Agile teams, utilizing CI/CD pipelines to automate code deployment seamlessly.

Crucially for businesses, containers optimize hardware and cloud resources. Unlike VM hypervisors such as Hyper-V, KVM, and Xen, which emulate virtual hardware and demand substantial system resources, containers share the underlying operating system, resulting in significantly leaner resource consumption. As noted by James Bottomley, formerly Parallels' CTO of server virtualization and prominent Linux kernel developer, "Containers leave behind the unnecessary overhead of VMs, delivering a compact, efficient environment tailored to your application." In essence, a finely-tuned container system can support four to six containers on hardware that traditionally accommodated only a single instance.

Today, a variety of container platforms exist. While Docker remains the most prominent, alternatives like LXC, runC, containerd, and podman offer similar functionalities and compatibility with common management tools.

## What is Docker?

Docker is built on top of LXC and operates similarly to other containers in terms of providing its own file system, storage, CPU, and RAM to any program running within it. The primary distinction from virtual machines (VMs) lies in container technology abstracting only the operating system kernel, while VMs abstract entire hardware devices. Docker derives all its advantages from this fundamental difference.

Why did Docker achieve widespread success compared to predecessors like FreeBSD Jails, Oracle Solaris Zones, and OpenVZ, which were technically sound but failed to capture market share? Part of Docker's success stemmed from its ubiquitous but behind-the-scenes implementation. For instance, Google utilized its own open-source container tool, lmctfy (Let Me Contain That For You), for more than a decade, powering services like Search, Gmail, and Google Docs within invisible containers.

Docker revolutionized container usage by enhancing deployment efficiency and security compared to earlier methods. Collaborating with major container players such as Canonical, Google, Red Hat, and Parallels on its pivotal open-source component libcontainer standardized container practices.

Docker contributed its container format, runtime, and related specifications to The Linux Foundation's Open Container Project, a move aimed at fostering industry-wide standardization. This initiative included transferring the entire libcontainer project, including nsinit and necessary modifications for independent operation from Docker.

Continuing its efforts in container standardization, Docker donated its open-source container runtime, containerd, to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Standardization played a critical role in Docker's success trajectory.

Unlike traditional container technologies, Docker supports software-defined networking (SDN), allowing DevOps teams to define container networks without reliance on physical hardware switches. This capability facilitates the setup of intricate network topologies via configuration files.

Furthermore, Docker and SDN empower the exploitation of microservices, enabling efficient application development through loosely coupled services that communicate over standard protocols like HTTP and TCP.

Ultimately, Docker's success can be attributed to its emergence as the optimal open technology during the cloud computing revolution, empowering users to harness cloud capabilities effectively.

## What is Container Monitoring?

Businesses often rely on Docker to manage hundreds to hundreds of thousands of containers running critical applications. To orchestrate these containers effectively, many turn to Kubernetes, which has become synonymous with container management. According to CNCF CTO Chris Aniszczyk, the integration of Kubernetes and containers is increasingly recognized as a bundled solution (source). While other container orchestration tools exist, Kubernetes leads the market by a significant margin. Nearly 90% of Kubernetes users now opt for cloud-managed services, reflecting a notable increase from previous years (Datadog).

However, Kubernetes primarily focuses on controlling, deploying, and scaling containers rather than monitoring them.

Monitoring containers presents unique challenges due to their ephemeral nature. Containers often spin up and down within minutes; in fact, the average lifespan of a Kubernetes container is just one day. Traditional monitoring tools designed for applications running on virtual or bare metal servers struggle to keep pace. By the time these tools generate a monitoring report, the container may have already disappeared, along with any logs it contained.

## The Benefits of Container Monitoring

Monitoring containers is crucial despite its complexity, as sysadmin Gary Williams aptly points out, "You canâ€™t have too much monitoring." This sentiment underscores the importance of comprehensive container monitoring.

Key benefits of container monitoring include:

Proactive Issue Identification: Detecting potential problems early to prevent system outages.
Optimizing Performance: Utilizing time-series data to enhance application performance.
Resource Allocation: Efficiently managing and allocating resources based on monitoring insights.
Early Problem Detection: Identifying and resolving issues promptly to maintain operational efficiency.

Container monitoring is especially critical due to the constant security threats faced by containerized applications, such as ransomware and cryptocurrency attacks. Monitoring not only ensures security but also optimizes performance, aligning with standard practices for monitoring all IT systems.

Monitoring solutions face various challenges in collecting observability data from containers. Effective methods include:

Deploying dedicated monitoring agents within containers or at the host level.
Employing log routers to automatically gather container-generated logs.
Utilizing Docker's logging driver to store logs centrally on the host.
Collecting metrics via Docker stats, Kubernetes metrics pipeline, or similar APIs.
Basic container metrics like memory utilization, CPU usage, and resource limits are essential. Additionally, real-time streaming logs, tracing capabilities, and overall observability contribute to comprehensive monitoring.

At a higher level, effective monitoring extends beyond individual containers to encompass the entire application stack. Minh Dao of LogDNA highlights this need: "Imagine a three-tiered web application where errors suddenly spike in the backend tier, causing container crashes. While container-specific logs aid in root cause analysis, understanding the error in the broader application context is crucial." This approach ensures that monitoring efforts address both specific container issues and broader application performance concerns.

In conclusion, robust container monitoring is indispensable for maintaining the reliability, security, and performance of containerized applications.

## The Five Best Container Monitoring Tools

Many of the top container monitoring tools are open-source programs. Utho offers foundational guides for starting with the Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack using Filebeat and Metricbeat with Kibana for log and metric analysis, and for setting up time-series analysis with Graphite and a Grafana Dashboard. With some effort, you can establish your own container monitoring system.

Below is a list of container monitoring programs in alphabetical order, rather than ranked from best to worst. Each tool has its strengths and weaknesses, often measuring different metrics. To ensure comprehensive monitoring of your containers, it's often necessary to use multiple tools from this list:

### Container Advisor (cAdvisor)

Google's Container Advisor (cAdvisor) is an open-source monitoring tool that operates as a daemon to gather, aggregate, and export resource usage and performance data from specified containers. It monitors each container's resource isolation parameters, historical resource usage, histograms of complete historical resource usage, and network statistics. This data is exported on a per-container and machine-wide basis.

cAdvisor natively supports Docker containers and is compatible with other container types out of the box. It exposes metrics compatible with Prometheus, allowing cAdvisor to collect data which Prometheus can then scrape. cAdvisor's container abstraction is rooted in lmctfy, enabling hierarchical nesting of containers.

You can deploy cAdvisor as Docker images on your hosts. It offers a web-based user interface (UI) and a RESTful API, facilitating direct monitoring of Docker containers and integration of metrics into external applications through web service endpoints.

## Datadog

Docker recommends Datadog for good reasonâ€”it offers comprehensive monitoring tools that track metrics related to containers, infrastructure, and applications.

Datadog provides a user-friendly UI and customizable dashboards where you can visualize real-time data using various types of visualizations such as time series graphs, query values, top lists, tables, heatmaps, tree maps, pie charts, host maps, log streams, lists, alert values, service maps, and more. It automatically correlates data and visualizes unusual behavior, making it easier to identify issues.

While Datadog's core technology is proprietary, the Datadog agent and other components that run on your machines and clouds are open-source. It supports monitoring through Trace requests, utilizing graphical visualizations and alerts to provide insights into services, applications, and platforms. Datadog integrates with various telemetry programs and protocols like StatsD, OpenMetrics, and OpenTelemetry, enabling extensive monitoring capabilities.

Although primarily offered as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Datadog can also be deployed on-premises for organizations requiring local deployment.

## Elasticsearch and Kibana

Elasticsearch is an open-source search engine built on the Apache Lucene library, designed for distributed, multitenant-capable full-text searching. It features an HTTP web interface and stores data in schema-free JSON documents, serving as the central component of the ELK stack.

Kibana, its companion tool, is an open user interface tailored for visualizing data stored in Elasticsearch and navigating the ELK Stack. With Kibana, you can monitor query loads and observe how requests flow through your applications. It offers a variety of classic UI dashboards including histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more, alongside robust document searching capabilities.

For container monitoring, Filebeat and Metricbeat are essential tools. Filebeat automatically detects containers and streams their logs directly to Elasticsearch for indexing and analysis. Metricbeat, deployed within containers, gathers critical system-level metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, file system activity, disk IO, and network IO statistics. Its modular design, implemented in Go, supports monitoring specific processes within containers like Apache, NGINX, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Prometheus. All collected data is easily accessible and actionable through Kibana's intuitive interface.

While Elasticsearch and Kibana offer substantial flexibility, mastering their configuration requires dedicated effort. However, the comprehensive insights and operational benefits they provide make this investment worthwhile for effective container monitoring and management.

## Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus and Grafana, both open-source tools, empower users to construct customized monitoring systems, albeit with a degree of complexity that promises substantial returns.

Prometheus operates on a time series data model, storing streams of timestamped values for metrics with labeled dimensions. As a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project, Prometheus collects metrics directly from containers or through a push gateway. It retains scraped samples locally and applies rules to aggregate data, generate new time series, or trigger user-defined alerts.

Focusing on reliability, Prometheus employs standalone servers with local time-series database storage, ensuring independence from external services. This design is particularly advantageous for dynamic environments like cloud-based containerized microservices, facilitating rapid issue identification and real-time feedback.

Prometheus provides its own web dashboard and exposes data through its API. Grafana serves as the default interface for visualizing Prometheus data, offering extensive capabilities for creating intuitive and informative dashboards.

## Sysdig

Sysdig is a commercial cloud monitoring platform that seamlessly integrates with Prometheus, providing access to time-series data without the need to develop a custom Prometheus monitoring setup.

Sysdig specializes in tracking Docker data directly from container metadata, enhancing security and monitoring capabilities. Docker itself recommends Sysdig as a monitoring solution for containerized applications.

Beyond container-specific metrics, Sysdig consolidates Linux monitoring functionalities into a unified interface by integrating deeply with the Linux kernel. It captures critical system calls and other operating system events, offering comprehensive insights at the operating system level.

This unique blend of Prometheus integration and deep OS visibility positions Sysdig as a robust and versatile monitoring tool.

## Conclusion

Monitoring your containers isn't just a luxuryâ€”it's essential. Without monitoring, managing containers is akin to navigating a dark, winding road without headlights.

The choice of monitoring solution depends on your specific needs, budget, and available IT resources. You have the option to build custom container monitoring systems using various open-source tools or opt for commercial solutions. Regardless of your choice, monitoring remains a critical component for ensuring the performance, health, and stability of your containerized web applications.
