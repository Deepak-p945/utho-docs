Microservices, defined as an architectural approach to application development. Unlike traditional monolithic applications, microservices are designed to be distributed and loosely coupled. This means that changes made by one team won't disrupt the entire application. The advantage of this approach is that development teams can quickly create new components of applications to adapt to changing business requirements.

The microservices architecture helps deliver big and complex apps quickly and reliably when required. For instance, when Microsoft releases monthly updates, it doesn't send out an entirely new installation of Windows. Instead, it distributes only the necessary updates, saving time and resources. Similarly, with microservices, updates involve pushing only the relevant code changes, rather than updating the entire application.

Cloud-native applications are typically deployed in containers, which are lightweight, portable environments for running applications. Unlike virtual machines, which require a full operating system and consume gigabytes of resources, containers utilize a fraction of the operating system and consume megabytes of resources. They virtualize the host operating system and isolate an application's dependencies from other containers, ensuring that a container failure doesn't affect the entire application.

Docker is the most widely used container manager, but there are several alternatives available. Kubernetes, developed by Google, is another essential component of cloud-native architecture. It's an open-source container management platform that orchestrates containers and manages their lifecycle. Kubernetes organizes applications into groups of containers using Docker and ensures that they run smoothly and efficiently.

## Key Distinctions Between Cloud-Native and On-Premises Applications

Cloud-native applications differ significantly from traditional on-premises enterprise applications in several key aspects:

- **Languages**: On-premises applications are typically coded in traditional languages like C/C++, Java, or COBOL for mainframes. In contrast, cloud-native apps often utilize modern web-centric languages such as Java, JavaScript, .Net, Node.js, PHP, Python, or Ruby.

- **Updateable**: Cloud-native applications are updated frequently through a DevOps process known as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). Unlike on-premises apps, updates to cloud-native apps can be installed without downtime, ensuring they remain continuously available.

- **Resilience**: Cloud-native apps leverage a microservices architecture, breaking down the application into independent services. If one service fails, it doesn't affect the entire system, unlike on-premises apps where a failure can bring down the entire application.

- **Elasticity**: Cloud-native apps can dynamically scale resources in response to changing demand, a feature known as elasticity. Extra compute resources are provisioned automatically during usage spikes and deallocated afterward, a capability unavailable to on-premises apps.

- **Multi-Tenancy**: Cloud-native apps are designed to operate in virtualized environments and share resources with other apps. On-premises apps often struggle in virtual environments, requiring dedicated resources for each instance.

- **Connected Resources**: On-premises apps often have hardcoded connections to resources like networks and storage, making them prone to breaking if resources are moved or changed. Cloud-native apps can automatically locate and utilize resources without manual intervention.

- **Automated**: Cloud-native environments heavily automate app management tasks. Container management tools like Docker and Kubernetes automate scaling, self-service, rollback, and performance monitoring. On-premises environments typically require manual intervention for these tasks.

## The Challenges

Moving old on-premises applications to cloud platforms like AWS or Azure without any modifications, known as "lift and shift," is a common mistake. This approach fails to leverage the benefits of the cloud, such as scalability and easy updates.

The key decision lies in choosing between migrating the existing on-premises app to the cloud or rebuilding it from scratch. Generally, the more extensive the required modifications, the more appealing it becomes to start fresh with a rewrite.
