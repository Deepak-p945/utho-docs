Compute containers bundle application code, libraries, and dependencies, enabling them to run seamlessly across various platforms like desktop PCs, traditional IT servers, or the cloud.

They stand out for their small size, speed, and portability. Unlike virtual machines, containers don't require a full operating system with each instance. Instead, they rely on the host OS for essential features and resources, minimizing overhead.

Containers are generated from container images, serving as pre-configured templates containing the container's system, applications, and environment. With container images, much of the container creation process is automated, leaving developers to focus on adding their specific application logic. Various templates are available for creating specialized containers, mirroring the plethora of libraries and templates for code development.

While numerous container template platforms exist, Docker leads the market. Launched in 2013, Docker offers tools for creating container images, managing repositories, and running containers across diverse environments. It hosts the largest distribution hub of container templates. For guidance on installing Docker on Linux systems, refer to our Installing and Using Docker guide.

Despite their reduced size and complexity, containers require management. Orchestration automates operational tasks related to running containerized workloads and services. This includes managing a container's lifecycle, deployment, scaling, networking, load balancing, and more. Among orchestration tools, [Kubernetes](/docs/guides/beginners-guide-to-kubernetes/) stands out as the most popular, originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

## Containers vs. Virtual Machines

Containers are often compared to Virtual Machines (VMs), and for good reason. They both allow multiple application environments to operate on the same physical hardware.

VMs laid the groundwork for the first generation of cloud computing. With the introduction of 64-bit computing and multi-core processors, servers surpassed the 4GB memory limit of 32-bit processors, enabling them to support numerous virtual environments. A single robust server can host hundreds of VMs, each requiring a full operating environment consuming one to two gigabytes of memory.

In contrast, containers offer a significantly streamlined operating environment, requiring as little as 6MB of memory. This means that hundreds of containers can coexist on a single server, provided there is enough memory and processing power.

While VM hypervisors virtualize the physical hardware, containers virtualize the operating system. Hypervisors manage all I/O and machine activities, balancing loads and handling physical tasks like processing and data movement.

Container managers, such as Kubernetes, handle software tasks that containers aren't configured for. The application within a container has access to its required libraries and dependencies. If it needs additional resources from the operating system, the container manager manages it.

Choosing between VMs and containers isn't an either/or decision. They can seamlessly coexist, with containers running inside VMs as needed.

## How Do Cloud Containers Work?

Container technology originated from Unix with the introduction of partition separation and chroot processes, later incorporated into Linux. Containers encapsulate their dependencies and libraries within the container itself, rather than relying on the underlying operating system. Applications running in containers are not full-fledged, complex applications like those in standard virtual or non-virtual environments. Each container operates in virtual isolation, with individual applications accessing a shared OS kernel without the need for separate virtual machines.

Cloud containers are designed to virtualize a single application, whether it's a simple, single-purpose app or a MySQL database. Unlike traditional virtualization, where isolation occurs at the server level, container isolation operates at the application level. This means that if a problem occurs, such as an app crash or excessive resource consumption by a process, it only affects the individual container rather than the entire virtual machine or server. The orchestrator can quickly replace the problematic container by spinning up a new one and can also handle container shutdowns and restarts in case of issues.

## The Benefits of Containers in Cloud Computing

The benefits of using containers are manifold and offer significant advantages over traditional approaches:

- Template Reusability: Similar to classes and libraries in object-oriented programming (OOP), containers employ templates that can be reused across multiple applications. A single container image serves as the foundation for creating multiple containers. This concept mirrors OOP's inheritance, where container images act as parent templates for more customized versions.

- Consistent Operation: Containers operate consistently across various environments, including desktops, local servers, and the cloud. This consistency simplifies testing before deployment, allowing for efficient local testing with the assurance of consistent performance in the cloud deployment setting.

- Lightweight and Portable: Containers outshine traditional virtual machines (VMs) in terms of being lightweight and portable. By sharing the machine OS kernel, containers eliminate much of the overhead associated with VMs. Their smaller size enables quick spin-up times and better support for cloud-native applications requiring horizontal scaling.

- Platform Independence: Containers encapsulate all their dependencies, making them platform-independent. They can run on different Linux distributions as long as they avoid making kernel calls.

- Supports Modern Development Architectures: Containers, with their deployment portability and consistency, along with their compact size, align perfectly with modern development and application methodologies such as Agile, DevOps, serverless, and microservices.

- Performance Improvement: Containerized applications are typically large applications broken down into manageable components. This modular approach offers performance benefits, as containers automatically scale resources based on demand, optimizing CPU cores, memory, and networking.

- Efficient Debugging: Containerization simplifies debugging by breaking down monolithic applications into components. This makes it easier to identify performance bottlenecks, allowing developers to pinpoint and address issues more quickly.

- Hybrid/Multi-cloud Support: Containers' portability enables seamless migration between on-premises and cloud environments, as well as across different cloud providers.

- Application Modernization: Containerization offers a pathway for modernizing legacy on-premises applications by containerizing them and migrating them to the cloud. However, it's essential to optimize the application for cloud-native benefits rather than simply lifting and shifting.

- Improves Resource Utilization: Unlike monolithic applications, where the entire application and its memory usage affect performance, containerized applications allow scaling of individual components as needed. This automatic scaling improves resource utilization and overall server performance.

## Conclusion

Containers have emerged as a favored solution for companies seeking to transition their on-premises applications to the cloud, enabling them to leverage the full spectrum of cloud benefits: scalability, elasticity, streamlined DevOps practices, and the ability to offload on-premises resources to a cloud provider.

The technology has matured significantly, with various alternatives to Docker, such as Microsoft Azure, and alternatives to Kubernetes, like Red Hat OpenShift, entering the market. Most cloud providers now offer pre-configured container services and orchestration solutions. Here at Utho, we provide a managed Kubernetes service to simplify container management.
