In modern development, efficiency is key. Both serverless applications and containers aim to streamline deployment, maintenance, and debugging in the cloud, replacing the heavier virtual machine approach. While containers provide a robust solution with everything needed to run an application, often as microservices, serverless applications offer a simpler approach focused on application code leveraging vendor APIs. There's no definitive right or wrong choice; it all depends on what best suits the organization's needs.

## What Is Serverless?

In serverless applications, functions respond to events on a vendor's system, freeing developers from server and hardware concerns. Backend services and libraries are typically provided by the vendor, allowing developers to focus solely on application code, without worrying about dependencies.

Serverless applications offer features like automatic scaling, provisioning, built-in service integration, automated configuration, and high availability, all without additional developer effort. This hosting model can significantly reduce dependency costs for organizations.

Serverless applications can support traditional desktop support, backend services, and serverless web applications. Unlike microservices, which are a method of designing applications, serverless applications represent a method of running them. Serverless functions don't run continuously but require an event to trigger execution, performing one task per function. While microservices can run continuously and support multiple functions, serverless applications incur lower costs in situations with frequent usage spikes, as they only run when triggered by an event.

### What Are Serverless Applications Used For?

Serverless applications are ideal for startups developing mobile and web applications due to their minimal initial costs and suitability for lightweight applications. They are commonly used in the following scenarios:

- Situations with unpredictable traffic patterns
- Internet of Things (IoT) applications
- Applications undergoing frequent and substantial changes
-Applications that can decompose tasks into individual functions and then combine them to create Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs)

### Considering the Serverless Application Process
When developing a serverless application, it's crucial to follow a specific process, regardless of whether you're building backend services, frontend services, or both. This process differs from working with monolithic applications, microservices, [Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs)](https://www.elasticpath.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-PBCs-and-microservices) or container applications. The goal is to break down the software requirement into smaller, simpler pieces. Here's how:

- Define individual services that handle specific tasks.
- Break down these services into individual functions, each performing a single task.
- Define events that trigger these functions. In serverless applications, functions start, do their job, and then stop.
- Create configuration files for each function.
- Develop a configuration provider file outlining how the function interacts with the serverless application framework.
- Establish a service configuration detailing the provider file, function files, and any plugins comprising the service.

## What Are Containers?

Containers and serverless applications offer different approaches to application deployment and management. Unlike serverless applications, which focus solely on the application code, containers encapsulate everything needed to run the application, including libraries, system settings, and dependencies. While this means more responsibility for developers, containers provide several advantages over serverless applications, such as avoiding vendor lock-in.

For example, Docker containers can run on any system supporting Docker, offering portability and standardization similar to shipping containers. Containers are dedicated to a single application, making them simpler and more resource-efficient compared to virtual machines. With containers, it's possible to run multiple instances of an application on a single physical machine, optimizing resource utilization.

However, containers and virtual machines differ in how they handle operating systems. Containers share a single kernel on the host machine, while each virtual machine has its own kernel. This distinction affects compatibility and resource allocation, with virtual machines offering more flexibility in kernel choice for specific applications.

### What are Containers Utilized For?

Containers serve various purposes, including:

- Deploying API endpoints
- Running repetitive jobs and tasks
- Supporting DevOps processes for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Hosting background processing applications
- Handling event-driven processing
- Implementing microservices architecture
- Migrating large legacy applications to the cloud

### Considering the Process of Containerizing Applications

Creating Container Applications: A Common Process

- [Break an existing monolithic application down into microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/break-monolith-into-microservices.html) if required.
- Develop a new container image based on an existing template.
- Incorporate code, resources, and other application files into the image using host commands.
- Configure the image's startup commands using host commands.
- Build and run the image within the container instead of externally.
- Use the host server's instance service to deploy the image.

## Similarities Between Serverless and Containers
Serverless applications and containers share similar approaches in breaking down solutions into smaller, more manageable components. Both aim to reduce costs, development time, and maintenance efforts, while also enhancing flexibility.

## What Are the Key Differences Between Serverless and Containers?

Despite their similarities, there are notable differences between the two technologies. They diverge in their utilization of physical machines, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and deployment management.

### Physical Machines

Serverless applications can operate across multiple physical machines, providing an inherent advantage in resource availability without requiring extensive developer intervention. On the other hand, container applications typically run on a single physical machine, necessitating more configuration and setup.

### Scalability

Scalability is another area of contrast. Serverless applications automatically scale to meet demand, as the hosting vendor dynamically allocates computing resources. In contrast, containerized applications require developers to manually allocate containers based on anticipated loads, potentially leading to under or over-provisioning.

While some cloud providers offer auto-scaling for virtual machines, it's typically configurable rather than actively managed by developers, as is the case with serverless platforms.

### Cost

When comparing operating costs, serverless applications appear more economical as they only run when needed, reducing operational expenses compared to containers. However, this cost advantage may diminish when considering application latency. Containers, being constantly active, provide immediate responses to requests. In contrast, serverless applications may experience additional latency, especially when loading from outside the cache. This latency translates to potential delays and costs, making container applications more cost-effective for consistently high loads where immediate responsiveness is crucial.

### Deployment Time

The deployment time for applications has significantly decreased over time. What previously took months with physical systems, then minutes with virtual machines, now takes seconds with containers and milliseconds with serverless applications. Serverless application developers enjoy a deployment time advantage due to their minimal dependencies and smaller size.

### Maintenance

In terms of maintenance, serverless applications require less direct upkeep as the hosting service handles maintenance tasks. While this offers a time-saving advantage for serverless developers, it also introduces potential issues such as unexpected vendor updates. On the other hand, container developers have more control over maintenance tasks, allowing them to address issues at their convenience. This control can ultimately save time in the long run, despite requiring more direct involvement initially.

### Testing
Testing serverless applications poses challenges due to their event-driven nature. Functions are triggered by events, execute tasks, and then shut down immediately. Developers often rely on application logs to identify issues. In contrast, container applications run continuously regardless of the environment, providing standardized debugging tools such as those available in IDEs like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debug-a-java-application-using-a-dockerfile.html).

## What Factors Should Developers Use to Choose Which One to Use?

Serverless applications excel in scenarios with rapid deployment needs, minimal maintenance requirements, and fluctuating workloads that can spike suddenly. They are well-suited for startups managing smaller, less complex applications without specific infrastructure demands.

On the other hand, container applications offer cost advantages for stable workloads and greater flexibility in application configuration. They are ideal for migrating legacy applications from on-premises servers to the cloud.

## Conclusion

Both serverless applications and containers have their pros and cons. Sometimes, the best approach is a hybrid solution, leveraging each technology where it excels. However, this approach introduces complexities in managing multiple technologies within a single solution, potentially impacting reliability and security.
