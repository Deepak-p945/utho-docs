Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of deploying and managing infrastructure using software, configuration files, and automated tools. This approach applies to various devices like web servers, routers, databases, load balancers, and even personal computers, across both on-premises and cloud environments. Unlike traditional methods that rely on manual configurations, IaC automates the process, allowing for scalable and efficient management. This guide delves into the origins, principles, and benefits of IaC, providing insights into its implementation and the array of available tools.

## Unraveling the Origins and Core Concepts of Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) emerged as a response to the challenges posed by traditional methods of managing network equipment. In the past, technicians had to manually configure each device, often using interactive tools or scripts. This manual approach led to inefficiencies, errors, and a lack of scalability, particularly for organizations with large networks.

However, advancements in virtualization, cloud computing, and software tools changed the landscape. These innovations reduced reliance on physical hardware and enabled automated provisioning, configuration, and management of servers. Additionally, the adoption of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices made the idea of treating infrastructure as code more appealing.

In the IaC paradigm, infrastructure provisioning is entirely automated using configuration files, definition files, and scripts. DevOps teams collaborate to define a strategy for the network, leveraging software development practices such as quality assurance and test automation. Changes to infrastructure configuration are implemented through alterations to the codebase, rather than manual adjustments to the infrastructure itself. This approach streamlines processes, enhances reliability, and facilitates scalability in managing infrastructure.

## Benefits of Adopting Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) aims to achieve important business goals. The main ones include:

### Cost

Manual configuration is expensive. It needs skilled technicians who earn professional salaries. Each technician can only set up one thing at a time, and each setup needs individual debugging. The only way to make it faster is by hiring more people.

On the other hand, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) initially costs more but saves money in the long term. IaC automates repetitive tasks, freeing up skilled staff to focus on more valuable work. This means companies can accomplish more without increasing their budget.

### Speed

Manual configuration is not only expensive but also slow. It's impossible to instantly deploy numerous devices or make timely changes or upgrades to networks.

On the flip side, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables swift activation of infrastructure and almost instant modifications to existing networks using scripts and configuration files. It simplifies and speeds up the process of developing and testing small changes to the codebase and distributing updates proactively. Setting up systems as required reduces overhead for testing and compliance. Faster deployment of changes means maintenance windows can be shorter and more frequent.

### Risk

When configuring manually, mistakes are more likely to occur, even with careful attention. If errors are discovered later, adjustments may compound the problem, adding irrelevant details or accidentally removing crucial features. Eventually, the configuration may deviate significantly from the intended setup.

In contrast, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) reduces the risk of errors by enforcing a systematic and thoroughly tested approach. It catches obvious issues much earlier in the development process. Additionally, IaC simplifies bug fixing, enabling developers to swiftly modify, test, and deploy source code.

### Consistency/Standardization

Without a standardized procedure, technicians may configure devices in different ways, leading to each network node becoming a unique "snowflake" with its own settings. This makes it hard to reproduce system states and troubleshoot issues. Changes might be made without fully understanding the original design or implications, leading to what's called "network drift" over time, causing instability.

In contrast, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) promotes consistency by using standard configuration files and software-based setups. A key IaC principle is "idempotence," meaning devices always reach the same state under the same conditions. This simplifies troubleshooting, testing, and upgrading. Predictable network behavior is ensured, along with standardized logging and error handling for easier troubleshooting and enhanced security. IaC also reduces issues caused by mismatched configurations or software versions, promotes code sharing among teams, and streamlines task division.

## Infrastructure as Code and DevOps

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is at the heart of the DevOps culture, blending development and operations. It fosters closer collaboration between software and infrastructure teams, ensuring consistent practices across the organization and integrating network deployments into the CI/CD pipeline.

IaC offers significant benefits, especially for large organizations deploying numerous devices daily and firms specializing in network services. However, even smaller software companies can leverage IaC to set up and manage their own environments.

A key advantage of IaC lies in its connection to automation, quality assurance, and version control. It's challenging to achieve this level of integration otherwise. With IaC, software changes undergo rigorous testing and validation through regression scripts and automated tests, enabling confident upgrades. Production and prototype testing occur earlier, reducing the risk of widespread deployment issues.

Automation facilitates comprehensive validation, including edge cases and stress testing. If problems arise, rolling back to a stable version is straightforward. All edits occur in the source configuration files, never directly on the target systems. Patches are only deployed after thorough testing and approval by QA.

Configuration files are managed in version control systems, simplifying rollback procedures and enabling collaboration between software and infrastructure teams. This ensures coordinated software and configuration changes and facilitates early development or prototyping through branching.

## Designing Infrastructure as Code

The Infrastructure as Code philosophy outlines a general process while allowing for flexibility in specific details. However, a successful implementation requires consideration of various specific factors. These decisions may differ among companies depending on their unique needs and resources.

### Choosing Between Declarative and Imperative Approaches

In a declarative approach, you describe the desired end state of a device without specifying how to achieve it. The IaC tool handles all the procedural decisions based on this description, typically outlined in a configuration file or JSON specification.

On the other hand, an imperative approach defines specific functions or procedures to configure the device, focusing on what needs to happen rather than the final state. This method often involves scripting and can be useful for integrating with legacy tools or as an initial step towards adopting Infrastructure as Code, especially for traditional organizations.

### Push Versus Pull Distribution

In a push configuration, the central server sends the configuration to the destination device. In a pull configuration, each device retrieves its configuration from a central distribution point by requesting it.

### Mutable Versus Immutable Infrastructure

Mutable devices allow their configurations to be altered while they're in use, enabling upgrades and changes without disrupting operations. In contrast, immutable devices cannot be altered; they must be decommissioned, rebooted, and then fully rebuilt. While this might seem drastic, it's a suitable approach for virtual infrastructure. Immutable devices prevent partial changes, ensuring consistency and preventing drift. However, rebuilding or removing configurations generally takes longer than making changes, so this method might not be ideal for time-sensitive situations.

## Challenges and Drawbacks of Infrastructure as Code

Maintaining and updating all the necessary code and configurations can increase organizational overhead and technical debt. Decisions about deployment become a collaborative effort between development and operations teams, potentially diverting developers from other critical design tasks. The complexity of the code may make it challenging to modify effectively.

Having all devices share a common and consistent configuration could make the network more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Additionally, some IaC tools may have known vulnerabilities, so system administrators must prioritize security considerations during the development process.

In software development, standardizing systems may lead to untested scenarios, as certain feature combinations may never occur together, even inadvertently.
