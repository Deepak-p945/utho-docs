Chef is a powerful platform that turns infrastructure setup into code. It helps streamline development and deployment by enabling thorough testing, smooth deployments, version control, and consistent environments across servers.

Chef operates through three primary components:

**Chef Server**: This acts as the central hub, storing and managing configuration data for all other Chef components.
**Chef Workstations**: Chef Workstations are like personal computers or virtual servers where you create, test, and tweak Chef configuration code. You can have multiple workstations, tailored to the needs of different users or tasks.
**Chef Nodes**: Nodes are the target servers that Chef applies changes to. These can include virtual servers, containers, network devices, and storage devices. Each node managed by Chef has a Chef client installed on it.

These three components work together in a mostly linear process: changes are made on workstations, pushed to the Chef server, and then pulled down to the nodes by the Chef client. The server receives information from nodes to determine which files need updating.

To delve deeper into using Chef, check out our guides on [Setting Up a Chef Server, Workstation, and Node on Ubuntu 18.04](/docs/guides/install-a-chef-server-workstation-on-ubuntu-18-04/) and [Creating Your First Chef Cookbook](/docs/guides/creating-your-first-chef-cookbook/).

## The Chef Server

The Chef server acts as a bridge between the workstations, where infrastructure coding happens, and the nodes that are configured by these workstations. Workstations create and store all configuration files, cookbooks, and other data on the Chef server. It also keeps track of the last [chef-client](#chef-client) nodes.

Workstations communicate with the Chef server using [*Knife*](/docs/guides/beginners-guide-chef/#knife) and Chef command-line tools, while nodes communicate with the Chef server using the [Chef client](/docs/guides/beginners-guide-chef/#chef-client).

For any changes in your infrastructure code to take effect on nodes, they must go through the Chef server. Before accepting or pushing changes, the Chef server verifies all communication through its REST API using public key encryption.

### Components of a Chef Server Explained

The Chef Server has different parts that help it work smoothly with workstations and nodes. It includes an NGINX front-end load balancer, a PostgreSQL database, an Apache Solr instance for indexing and searching (wrapped by chef-solr), and a web interface called Chef Automate for managing tasks and analyzing data. These components allow the Chef Server to handle requests from thousands of nodes. However, because it uses a lot of resources, the minimum system requirements for a Chef Server are 8 GB of RAM and four CPU cores on a Utho.

### Bookshelf

In Chef Server, there's a place called the Bookshelf where it keeps all its cookbooks along with their files and templates. This Bookshelf acts like a library, with different versions of cookbooks stored in it. Typically, it's found at `/var/opt/opscode/bookshelf`, and you need full access rights to get into it.

When someone uploads a cookbook to the Chef server, the server checks if it's a new version or not. If it's a new version, it compares it with the old one. If there are any changes, the new version gets saved. However, the Chef server is smart – it doesn't store multiple copies of the same file or template. So, if there are resources shared among different cookbooks or versions, it keeps only one copy to save space.

## The Chef Workstation

A Chef workstation is where users do the bulk of their work with Chef. Here, they create, test, and manage cookbooks and policies that get sent to the Chef server and then pulled down by the Chef nodes. To set up a workstation, you'll need to download the [Chef Workstation package](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation/). This package gives you access to a bunch of tools like chef and knife for command-line tasks, testing tools like Test Kitchen, ChefSpec, Cookstyle, and Foodcritic, as well as [InSpec](https://www.chef.io/inspec/), which is used for writing automated tests to check compliance, security, and policy requirements. Also, it includes *Berkshelf*, which is a dependency manager for Chef cookbooks.

You can install the Chef workstation on either virtual servers or personal computers. Each workstation interacts with a single Chef server, and most of the action happens within the `chef-repo` directory right on the workstation.

Cookbooks created on a Chef workstation can be kept private for one organization's use or shared with others by uploading them to the Chef Supermarket. Conversely, workstations can also download cookbooks from the Supermarket.

For more detailed information on Chef Workstation and its tools, you can check out Chef's [official documentation](https://docs.chef.io/workstation).

### chef-repo

The `chef-repo` directory on a Chef workstation is like the control center for managing cookbooks. It's where you create and look after your cookbooks, along with any other related stuff like roles, data bags, and environments. It's essential to keep your `chef-repo` organized and safe, so it's a good idea to use a version control system like Git to manage it. With Git, you can keep track of changes and collaborate with others easily.

From this `chef-repo`, you can communicate with the Chef server and send any updates using commands through `knife`, which is like a Swiss Army knife for Chef tasks.

To get started with your `chef-repo`, you can generate one using this simple command: `chef generate repo repo-name`. This sets up the basic structure for your Chef repository.

### Knife

The Knife command-line tool is how a workstation talks to a Chef server and manages the stuff in its chef-repo directory. It's like the remote control for Chef operations, letting you handle nodes, cookbooks, roles, environments, and databags.

- When you run a Knife command from your workstation, it follows this format:

      knife subcommand [ARGUMENT] (options)

- To see the details of a Chef user, just run this command:

      knife user show USER_NAME

The configuration of the Knife command-line tool is set up using the knife.rb file.

    {{< file "~/chef-repo/.chef/knife.rb" ruby >}}
    log_level                :info
    log_location             STDOUT
    node_name                'username'
    client_key               '~/chef-repo/.chef/username.pem'
    validation_client_name   'shortname-validator'
    validation_key           '~/chef-repo/.chef/shortname.pem'
    chef_server_url          'https://123.45.67.89/organizations/shortname'
    syntax_check_cache_path  '~/chef-repo/.chef/syntax_check_cache'
    cookbook_path [ '~/chef-repo/cookbooks' ]
    {{< /file >}}

The default `knife.rb` file comes with the following settings:

**log_level**: This determines how much detail gets logged in the log file. By default, it's set to :info, which logs informational messages. You can also set it to `:debug`, `:warn`, `:error`, or :`fatal`.

**log_location**: This specifies where the log file is stored. By default, it's set to `STDOUT` for logging to the standard output. If you set it to another location, it will still log to the standard output.

**node_name**: This is the username of the person using the workstation. The user must have a valid authorization key stored on the workstation.

**client_key**: This indicates the location of the user's authorization key.

**validation_client_name**: It's the name for the server validation key, which verifies whether a node is registered with the Chef server. During a chef-client run, these values must match.

**validation_key**: This is the path to your organization's validation key.

**chef_server_url**: It's the URL of the Chef server. You should replace shortname with your organization's defined `shortname` or an IP address. The URL must include `/organizations/shortname`.

**syntax_check_cache_path**: This is where knife stores information about files checked for proper Ruby syntax.

**cookbook_path**: It's the path to the directory where cookbooks are stored.

Knife offers various other useful operations for managing the Chef server and nodes. Check out Chef's [Knife](https://docs.chef.io/knife.html) documentation for a full list of available commands.

### Test Kitchen

Test Kitchen sets up a sandbox on your workstation where you can develop, test, and refine your cookbooks before deploying them to live nodes. With the Kitchen command-line tool, you can run integration tests across various platforms, mimicking the diverse environments your production nodes might have. Check out the [Kitchen CI](https://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/introduction/) documentation to learn how to get started with Test Kitchen.

## The Chef Node

A Chef node is basically any machine that's under the management of a Chef server. This could be virtual servers, containers, network devices, or storage devices – pretty much anything you need to keep in line with your configurations.

To work with Chef, each node needs to have the Chef client software installed. This client follows instructions from Chef to make sure the node matches the desired state laid out in your cookbooks.

When a node is set up, it gets validated through certificates called `validator.pem` and `client.pem`. These certificates are made when the node is first set up, typically over SSH, either as the root user or with elevated privileges.

To keep nodes in sync with the Chef server, there's a process called `chef-client` that runs regularly. It ensures that the configurations on the node match what's defined on the Chef server. The specific roles and tasks a node performs are determined by its run list and environment settings.

### chef-client


On a node, the chef-client software compares what's currently set up on that computer with the recipes and rules saved on the Chef server. It then updates the computer to match.

First, the chef-client looks at the list of tasks it needs to do (called the "run list"), loads the necessary instructions (called cookbooks), and then checks and syncs those instructions with what's already on the computer.

To work properly, the chef-client needs to be given special permission to make changes on the computer. It should be set to run regularly to keep the computer always up to date. Usually, this is done with a scheduled task (like using cron) or by making the chef-client run continuously as a background service.

### Run Lists

Run lists determine which [recipes](/docs/guides/beginners-guide-chef/#recipes) a Chef node will use. It's like a to-do list that tells the chef-client software which [*roles*](http://docs.chef.io/server_manage_roles.html) and recipes it needs to get from the Chef server. Roles are like templates that define common setups and settings across different nodes.

### Ohai

[Ohai](https://docs.chef.io/ohai/) gathers important system details needed for cookbooks and is essential on every Chef node. It's automatically installed when setting up a node.

It collects various system information like network usage, memory, CPU details, kernel information, and more. This data is crucial for the Chef client to understand the state of the node before applying any changes listed in its run list.

## Environments

Chef environments replicate how tasks are managed in real life, helping organize nodes into various groups based on their roles within the system. This allows users to assign different settings to different groups of nodes using versioned cookbooks. For instance, when testing an online shopping cart, you might want to avoid making changes to the live website but experiment on a separate group of development nodes.

Environments are configured in the `chef-repo/environments` directory and saved either as Ruby or JSON files.
As a Ruby file:

    {{< file "chef-repo/environments/environame.rb" ruby >}}
    name "environmentname"
    description "environment_description"
    cookbook_versions  "cookbook" => "cookbook_version"
    default_attributes "node" => { "attribute" => [ "value", "value", "etc." ] }
    override_attributes "node" => { "attribute" => [ "value", "value", "etc." ] }
    {{< /file >}}

As a JSON:

    {{< file "chef-repo/environments/environame.json" json >}}
    {
    "name": "environmentname",
    "description": "a description of the environment",
    "cookbook_versions": {

    },
    "json_class": "Chef::Environment",
    "chef_type": "environment",
    "default_attributes": {

    },
    "override_attributes": {

    }
    {{< /file >}}

When nodes are first set up, they're automatically assigned to the "default" environment. If you want to switch a node to a different environment, you can do so by editing the `/etc/chef/client.rb` file on the node.

## Cookbooks

Cookbooks are essential for setting up configurations on nodes. They hold key information about how a node should be configured to reach its *desired state*. With cookbooks, the Chef server and Chef client work together to make sure the node matches this desired setup.

A cookbook consists of various parts like recipes, metadata, attributes, resources, templates, and libraries, all aimed at creating a fully functional system. Among these, attributes and recipes are the core elements. It's important for these cookbook components to be modular, with small, related recipes.

It's crucial to keep cookbooks under version control. This allows for easy distribution and collaboration among team members, especially when working with different Chef environments.

### Recipes


Recipes, typically written in Ruby, outline what actions should be performed, modified, or established on a node. They're essentially a set of instructions that dictate the configuration or rules a node should follow. Each recipe is made up of *resources*, which are the building blocks defining specific configurations within the recipe. To execute a recipe on a node, it needs to be included in that node's run list.

For instance, in the [Vim cookbook](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/vim) provided by Chef, there's a recipe that determines the necessary Vim package based on the Linux distribution running on the node:

    {{< file "~/chef-repo/cookbooks/vim/packages.rb" >}}
    ...

    vim_base_pkgs = value_for_platform_family(
    %w(debian arch) => ['vim'],
    %w(rhel fedora) => ['vim-minimal', 'vim-enhanced'],
    'default' => ['vim']
    )

    package vim_base_pkgs

    package node['vim']['extra_packages'] unless node['vim']['extra_packages'].empty?
    {{</ file >}}


### Attributes

Attributes are like specific details about a node and its setup. They're often used alongside templates and recipes to configure settings. These attributes are applied using the attribute list managed by the Chef client. The Chef client collects attributes from various sources like nodes, attribute files, recipes, environments, and roles. You can find more information about attributes in [Chef's documentation](https://docs.chef.io/attributes.html).

### Files

In Chef, `files` are the static files that get uploaded to nodes. They can include configuration files, setup files, scripts, website files, and more. For instance, if you have a recipe that needs an `index.php` file, you can use a `cookbook_file` resource block within the recipe to create that file on a node. All these static files should be stored in the 'files' directory of a cookbook.

### Libraries

Chef includes some libraries by default, but you can also define additional ones. Libraries enable you to write Ruby code to include in a cookbook. They're handy for adding helper code to your existing recipes, extending their functionality. Libraries offer a powerful way to enhance the resources created by your recipes.

### Resources

Resources are pieces of code written in Ruby and defined in recipe files. Each resource must have a type, a name, one or more properties, and one or more actions. Resources are the fundamental building blocks of any recipe.

### Templates

Templates are special Ruby files with the extension `.erb` that are used to generate static text files dynamically. To use a template in a Chef cookbook, you need to declare a template resource in a recipe and include a corresponding `.erb` file in a `template` subdirectory. In your template resource, you can include variables that the template will use to dynamically fill in values based on the specific context of a node.

## Chef Beginners' Q&A

### Why use Chef?

Apart from automating deployments, Chef supports continuous delivery by employing an ["Infrastructure as Code"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) approach. This method is crucial for organizations embracing DevOps principles.

### What are the disadvantages to Chef?

Chef users who lack familiarity with coding, especially in Ruby, might face a challenging learning curve.

### Where can I learn about Chef in-depth?
