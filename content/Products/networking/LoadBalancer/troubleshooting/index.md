# Troubleshooting Guide for Utho Cloud Load Balancer

## Common Issues

### 1. Load Balancer Not Distributing Traffic Evenly
**Problem:** The load balancer is not distributing traffic evenly across the backend servers.

**Solution:**
- **Server Health:** Ensure all backend servers are healthy and passing health checks. Unhealthy servers are automatically removed from the pool.
- **Sticky Sessions:** Check if sticky sessions (session persistence) are enabled. This can cause a user's session to consistently be routed to the same server.
- **Load Balancing Algorithm:** Review the load balancing algorithm (round-robin, least connections, etc.) and ensure it is configured as expected.
- **Rule Configuration:** Verify the load balancing rules and ensure there are no misconfigurations causing uneven traffic distribution.

### 2. Connectivity Issues
**Problem:** Users are experiencing connectivity issues with the load balancer.

**Solution:**
- **Backend Server Health:** Confirm that all backend servers are running and accessible.
- **Firewall Rules:** Ensure that firewall rules are not blocking traffic to or from the load balancer.
- **Network Configuration:** Check network configurations, including subnets and routing tables, to ensure proper connectivity.
- **Logs and Monitoring:** Use logs and monitoring tools to identify any issues in the traffic flow and troubleshoot accordingly.

### 3. SSL Termination Not Working
**Problem:** SSL termination on the load balancer is not functioning correctly.

**Solution:**
- **SSL Certificate:** Verify that the SSL certificate is correctly configured and uploaded to the load balancer.
- **Protocol Settings:** Ensure that the load balancer is configured to handle HTTPS traffic and that the backend servers can handle the traffic correctly.
- **Health Checks:** Make sure that health checks are configured to check the appropriate ports and protocols.

### 4. Backend Servers Not Responding
**Problem:** The load balancer reports that backend servers are not responding.

**Solution:**
- **Health Checks:** Review and adjust health check settings to ensure they correctly reflect the health of backend servers.
- **Server Configuration:** Ensure that backend servers are configured to respond to health check requests and that they are operational.
- **Network Issues:** Check for any network issues that might be preventing communication between the load balancer and the backend servers.

## Error Messages

### 1. "Backend Server Unreachable"
**Error:** `Backend Server Unreachable`

**Solution:**
- **Network Configuration:** Verify that the backend servers are reachable from the load balancer. Check subnets and routing tables.
- **Firewall Rules:** Ensure that firewall rules allow traffic between the load balancer and backend servers.
- **Server Status:** Confirm that backend servers are running and not experiencing downtime.

### 2. "SSL Certificate Error"
**Error:** `SSL Certificate Error`

**Solution:**
- **Certificate Validity:** Ensure the SSL certificate is valid and not expired.
- **Correct Certificate:** Verify that the correct certificate is installed and associated with the load balancer.
- **Protocol Settings:** Check that the load balancer is configured to use the correct protocols for SSL/TLS traffic.
