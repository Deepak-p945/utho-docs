<!-- # Overview -->

# Introduction
The Utho Cloud TargetGroup is a key component in managing and distributing network traffic efficiently. TargetGroups enable you to group multiple endpoints (such as servers or containers) and manage how traffic is directed to them. This is especially useful in conjunction with load balancers, allowing for fine-tuned control over traffic routing based on specific criteria.

# Purpose
The purpose of the Utho Cloud TargetGroup is to provide a centralized and organized method for directing traffic to the appropriate backend resources. By grouping targets, you can apply consistent traffic distribution policies, health checks, and scaling strategies, ensuring high availability and reliability for your applications.

# System Requirements
To effectively utilize the Utho Cloud Firewall, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Utho Cloud Account:** A valid Utho Cloud account with administrative privileges.
- **Network Configuration:** Properly configured virtual networks and subnets within Utho Cloud.
- **Supported Browsers:** The latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for accessing the Utho Cloud Management Console.
- **Operating System:** No specific OS requirements for the firewall itself, but ensure the management console can be accessed from your systemâ€™s OS.
- **Connectivity:** Stable internet connection to manage firewall settings and monitor traffic.
