<!-- # Overview -->

# Introduction
The Utho Cloud Load Balancer is a highly available and scalable service designed to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization, minimizing response time, and avoiding overloading any single server. This enhances the availability and reliability of your applications by spreading the load evenly.

# Purpose
The purpose of the Utho Cloud Load Balancer is to improve the performance and reliability of your applications. By distributing incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, the load balancer ensures that no single server becomes a bottleneck, thereby providing high availability, fault tolerance, and improved overall system performance.

# System Requirements
To effectively utilize the Utho Cloud Firewall, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Utho Cloud Account:** A valid Utho Cloud account with administrative privileges.
- **Network Configuration:** Properly configured virtual networks and subnets within Utho Cloud.
- **Supported Browsers:** The latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for accessing the Utho Cloud Management Console.
- **Operating System:** No specific OS requirements for the firewall itself, but ensure the management console can be accessed from your systemâ€™s OS.
- **Connectivity:** Stable internet connection to manage firewall settings and monitor traffic.
