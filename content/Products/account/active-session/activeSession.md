The Active Sessions page displays a list of all devices currently logged into your account. This helps you keep track of where your account is accessed and ensures your account security.

1. **Accessing Active Sessions:**
   * Navigate to your account settings.
   * Click on the **Active Sessions** tab to view the list of devices.
2. **Understanding the Active Sessions List:**
   The Active Sessions page displays the following information for each device:
   * **Browser/Device:** The name or type of the browser or device where your account is logged in.
   * **IP Address:** The IP address from which the device is accessing your account.
   * **Time:** The date and time when the device logged into your account.
   * **Logout Button:** A button to log out from the specific device.

### Logging Out from a Device

If you notice any unfamiliar devices or simply want to log out from a specific session, you can do so easily:

1. **Identify the Device:**
   * Review the list of active sessions.
   * Identify the device you want to log out from by checking the browser/device type, IP address, and login time.
2. **Log Out:**
   * Click the **Logout** button next to the device entry.
   * Confirm the logout action when prompted. This will immediately terminate the session on the selected device.

### Ensuring Account Security

Regularly reviewing and managing active sessions helps maintain your account security. If you notice any suspicious activity, take the following steps:

1. **Log Out from Unrecognized Devices:**
   * Immediately log out from any devices you do not recognize using the **Logout** button.
2. **Change Your Password:**
   * Navigate to your account settings and change your password to ensure no unauthorized access.
3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
   * Consider enabling 2FA for an added layer of security. This can usually be done from the security settings in your account.

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

* **Session Not Logging Out:**
  * If you encounter issues logging out from a device, refresh the page and try again. Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
* **Unrecognized Device:**
  * If you see a device you do not recognize, log out immediately and change your password. Enable 2FA for added security.
