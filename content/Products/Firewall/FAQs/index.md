# FAQs for Utho Cloud Firewall

## General Questions

### 1. What is a firewall?

A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

### 2. What does the Utho Cloud Firewall offer?

The Utho Cloud Firewall provides advanced security features to protect your cloud infrastructure. It allows you to define and enforce security rules for network traffic, ensuring only authorized connections reach your resources.

### 3. How does a firewall enhance security?

Firewalls enhance security by:
- Filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on defined rules.
- Blocking unauthorized access attempts and malicious traffic.
- Monitoring network activity to detect and respond to security threats.
- Enforcing security policies to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.

## Technical Questions

### 1. How do I create a firewall rule?

To create a firewall rule in Utho Cloud:
1. Log in to your Utho Cloud account and navigate to the Firewall section.
2. Go to the Firewall Rules tab and click on Add Rule.
3. Define the rule details such as name, priority, source and destination IP addresses, protocol, port range, and action (Allow or Deny).
4. Save the rule to apply it to your firewall configuration.

### 2. Can I customize firewall rules based on specific applications?

Yes, you can customize firewall rules to allow or block traffic based on specific applications, protocols, ports, and IP addresses. This flexibility allows you to tailor security policies to meet your organization's needs.

### 3. What are default policies in the Utho Cloud Firewall?

Default policies in the Utho Cloud Firewall specify the default actions (Allow or Deny) for inbound and outbound traffic that does not match any explicitly defined firewall rules. These policies help ensure consistent security enforcement across your network.

## Troubleshooting

Firewall rules may not be applied due to:
- Incorrect rule configurations (e.g., conflicting rules, syntax errors).
- Firewall hardware or software issues.

- Insufficient permissions to modify firewall settings.

### 2. How do I troubleshoot firewall performance issues?
