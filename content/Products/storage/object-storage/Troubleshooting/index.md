## Common Issues

### 1. Unable to Access Storage Bucket
**Problem:** You cannot access your storage bucket.

**Solution:**
- **Permissions:** Ensure your account has the necessary permissions to access the bucket. Check the bucket's access control list (ACL) and bucket policies.
- **Bucket Name:** Verify that the bucket name is correct and exists in your account.
- **Region:** Ensure you are trying to access the bucket in the correct region.
- **Network Configuration:** Check your network settings to ensure there are no restrictions or firewall rules blocking access to Utho Cloud endpoints.

### 2. Slow Data Transfer Speeds
**Problem:** Data transfer to or from the storage bucket is slow.

**Solution:**
- **Network Connection:** Check your internet connection for stability and speed.
- **Region Selection:** Ensure your bucket is located in the nearest region to minimize latency.
- **Multipart Upload:** Use multipart upload for large files to improve transfer speed.
- **Bandwidth:** Verify that your bandwidth is sufficient for the desired transfer rate. Consider upgrading your bandwidth if necessary.
- **Performance Settings:** Adjust performance settings in your Utho Cloud Management Console for optimal data transfer.

### 3. Data Not Showing in Bucket
**Problem:** Uploaded data is not visible in the storage bucket.

**Solution:**
- **Upload Confirmation:** Ensure the upload process completed successfully and check for any error messages.
- **Bucket Refresh:** Refresh the bucket view in the Utho Cloud Management Console to see the latest data.
- **Access Permissions:** Verify that you have the necessary permissions to view the uploaded data.
- **List Objects API:** Use the List Objects API to ensure the data is present in the bucket and check for any issues with object visibility.

### 4. File Corruption During Upload
**Problem:** Files appear to be corrupted after being uploaded to the storage bucket.

**Solution:**
- **Checksum Verification:** Use checksums to verify file integrity before and after upload.
- **Multipart Upload:** Use multipart upload to minimize the risk of corruption during large file transfers.
- **Retry Logic:** Implement retry logic in your upload process to handle transient network issues.
- **Client-Side Encryption:** Ensure client-side encryption is correctly configured if you are using it.

### 5. Exceeding Storage Limits
**Problem:** You have exceeded your storage quota.

**Solution:**
- **Storage Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your storage usage in the Utho Cloud Management Console.
- **Upgrade Plan:** Consider upgrading your storage plan to accommodate increased data storage needs.
- **Data Cleanup:** Delete unnecessary or outdated data to free up space.
- **Automated Lifecycle Policies:** Implement automated lifecycle policies to manage data retention and deletion.
