Utho's resize plans allow users to upgrade or downgrade their cloud server's resources by selecting from predefined plans.

Utho's Rebuild functionality allows users to completely rebuild their cloud server.  

**Note** : This action will destroy all data on the server and reinstall a fresh operating system. There are two ways to rebuild the cloud server:![1718870521864](image/index/1718870521864.png)

### 1. Using Operating System

Users can select an operating system image from the available list to reinstall on their cloud server.

### 2. Using Marketplace

Users can choose an image from the marketplace to rebuild their cloud server.

### Rebuild Process

1. **Select an Image** : Choose an image either from the operating system list or the marketplace.
2. **Input Confirmation** : Fill in the confirmation text in the provided form:
   `I am aware this action will delete data permanently and build a fresh server.`
3. **Rebuild Button** : Click the "Rebuild Cloud Server" button to initiate the rebuild process.

Upon confirmation and clicking the rebuild button, the server will start the rebuilding process with the selected image, resulting in a fresh installation of the operating system and complete data loss.
