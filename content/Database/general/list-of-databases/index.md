Databases power nearly every digital platform on the planet, from websites and blogs to social media and streaming services. While many end-users view databases like MySQL as tools for storing data, this description, while accurate, only scratches the surface of what databases truly represent.

## The Different Types of Databases

The term "database" often conflates two distinct components: the database itself, which stores data, and the Database Management System (DBMS), the set of tools used to manage that data. Here, we focus on the DBMS, which enables database administrators to interact with and govern the database effectively.

Database Management Systems consist of three main layers:

- **Client**: Initiates requests via command line or GUI screens using valid SQL queries.
- **Server**: Manages all logical functions of the DBMS.
- **Storage**: Handles data storage operations.

These layers include essential tools such as thread handlers, query languages, parsers, optimizers, query caches, buffers, table metadata caches, and key caches. Together, they form a robust system that facilitates data storage and retrieval for administrators, users, and software.

A critical component of any DBMS is its query language, a specialized language used to interact with databases according to the DBMS specifications. While some DBMSs have proprietary query languages, the most popular ones include:

- **SQL**: Structured Query Language, widely used by databases like MS SQL and MySQL.
- **XQuery**: Utilizes XML file formats for data extraction and manipulation.
- **OQL**: Object Query Language, default language for object-oriented databases often used in Big Data scenarios.
- **SQL/XML**: Combines SQL with XQuery, supporting SQL statements on XML data.
- **GraphQL**: Open-source language for querying APIs and existing data.
- **LINQ**: Language Integrated Query, extracts and processes data from various sources including XML documents and relational databases.

## Relational and Non-Relational Databases

Database Management Systems (DBMSs) utilize two primary types of databases: Relational and Non-Relational. Understanding their differences is crucial for determining the best use case for a database.

A relational database organizes information into tables containing related data. What distinguishes a relational database is its ability to establish relationships between tables. These relationships link rows from different tables into a cohesive structure. Relational databases excel when data stability and accuracy are paramount, and the data structure remains relatively static.

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL Databases, store information in non-tabular formats. They employ various data models, with the four most common types being:

- **Document-oriented**: Stores data as JSON documents.
- **Key-value**: Stores data in key pairs.
- **Graph**: Stores data in a node-edge-node structure.
- **Wide-column**: Stores data in a tabular format with flexible columns that can vary between rows.

Due to their flexible data storage models, non-relational databases are highly versatile. They can accommodate diverse data types effectively, making them ideal for handling complex and voluminous data, such as in Big Data applications.

## What to Look for in a Database

The initial question to consider is whether to use a relational or non-relational database. A relational database is well-suited for scenarios requiring ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, data accuracy, normalization, and simplicity, but not necessarily scalability, flexibility, or high performance. A prime example of a relational database use case is a dynamic, database-driven website like WordPress.

Conversely, a non-relational database is preferable when data flexibility, speed, and scalability are critical. A typical example of a non-relational database use case is a cloud-based application that necessitates extensive scaling.

## Eight Popular Databases
