If a computer, like your laptop or phone, has to communicate over the internet, they use each other IP addresses with a remote computer, like a web server. People don’t remember IP addresses very well, but they remember the words and phrases in domain names well. Domain names can be used by the DNS system when interfacing with the computer, but computers can still use IP addresses when communicating with each other.\nIn this guide we examine how a DNS server that is the authoritative DNS server for your domain names can be installed and configured.

The first is to define the global parameters to make BIND work as we want. The second step is to create the domain-based DNS data to be used by BIND. This is called “area information” or “area records.”\nThe global parameters are configured in this section.\nIn /etc/named.conf we are going to edit the first configuration file and configure how bind works. Open your favorite text editor for this file.\n[root@Microhost]# vi /etc/named.conf Add the below line while editing the domain name according to your requirement at the bottom of the file.\nzone \"exmaple.com\" { type master; file \"/var/named/forward.example.com\"; }; zone \"10.100.51.198.in-addr.arpa\" { type master; file \"/var/named/everse.example.com\"; }; The following lines are used in this file:\nzone – this is the domain name or IP address for which BIND responds to requests. Type master – BIND reads the local storage zone information and provides the relevant domain information for the zone line. File – the zone information file. Two sections have the same syntax as you can see in this file. The first section contains the domain name example.com known as the forward DNS record. This means that domain information is converted to IP addresses.\nThe second latter is the server IP address’ reverse dns or PTR record. This turns the other way round, i.e. Domain name to IP addresses. The reverse record zone line looks a bit odd, since the IP address is in reverse. The IP address of 198.51.100.10, which forms the reverse record.\nInverse records are important as many safety systems, such as spam filters, are less likely to accept e-mails sent from a non-reverse IP address.\nNow that the global setup of BIND is set, the area files can be created that hold the DNS information forward and reverse.","installation-of-dns-server#Installation of DNS Server":"This guide is used for BIND’s DNS server.

By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for them. This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother. You should remove them before moving into a production environment. Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y ← Enter “y” to disable that user … Success! Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network. Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] n ← Enter “n” for no … skipping. By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can access.

If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB installation should now be secure. Thanks for using MariaDB! Now MariaDB configuration has been completed. We will proceed for the installation of PowerDNS:\n[root@Microhost]# yum -y install pdns pdns-backend-mysql The PowerDNS configuration file lists /etc/pdns/pdns, but a MySQL database for PowerDNS service is configured before editing. We first log on to the MySQL server and build a powerdns named database:\n[root@Microhost]# # mysql -u root -p MariaDB [(none)]\u003e CREATE DATABASE powerdns; Now we create the database user as following:\nMariaDB [(none)]\u003e GRANT ALL ON powerdns.* TO 'powerdns'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'COMPLX_Password'; MariaDB [(none)]\u003e GRANT ALL ON powerdns.* TO 'powerdns'@'centos7.localdomain' IDENTIFIED BY 'COMPLX_Password'; MariaDB [(none)]\u003e FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Replace COMPLEX_Password with your password:\nWe will create database tables which will be used in future by powerdns:\nMMariaDB [(none)]\u003e USE powerdns; MariaDB [(none)]\u003e CREATE TABLE domains ( id INT auto_increment, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, master VARCHAR(128) DEFAULT NULL, last_check INT DEFAULT NULL, type VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL, notified_serial INT DEFAULT NULL, account VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT NULL, primary key (id) ); MariaDB [(none)]\u003e CREATE UNIQUE INDEX name_index ON domains(name); MariaDB [(none)]\u003e CREATE TABLE records ( id INT auto_increment, domain_id INT DEFAULT NULL, name VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL, type VARCHAR(6) DEFAULT NULL, content VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL, ttl INT DEFAULT NULL, prio INT DEFAULT NULL, change_date INT DEFAULT NULL, primary key(id) ); MariaDB [(none)]\u003e CREATE INDEX rec_name_index ON records(name); MariaDB [(none)]\u003e CREATE INDEX nametype_index ON records(name,type); MariaDB [(none)]\u003e CREATE INDEX domain_id ON records(domain_id); MariaDB [(none)]\u003e CREATE TABLE supermasters ( ip VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL, nameserver VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, account VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT NULL ); Now exit from Mysql:\nMariaDB [(none)]\u003e quit; We can finally configure our PowerDNS so that it uses MySQL as a backend.\nOpen the configuration file of PowerDNS located at:\nvi /etc/pdns/pdns.conf It will look like:\n################################# launch Which backends to launch and order to query them in\nlaunch=\nCopy the below codes and put at the end of the file: launch=gmysql gmysql-host=localhost gmysql-user=powerdns gmysql-password=COMPLEX_Password gmysql-dbname=powerdns\nThe password \"COMPLEX\\_Password\" should be the same as previous one. Save the file with **:wq** and exit from the text editor. Now we will start and enable the service of Powerdns as following: [root@Microhost]# systemctl enable pdns.service\n[root@Microhost]# systemctl start pdns.service\n## Installing PowerAdmin console to Manage PowerDNS PowerAdmin – a friendly Web interface designed to manage PowerDNS servers, is now being installed. We have to install PHP and a web server (Apache) because it is written in PHP. [root@Microhost]# yum install httpd php php-devel php-gd php-imap php-ldap php-mysql php-odbc php-pear php-xml php-xmlrpc php-mbstring php-mcrypt php-mhash gettext\nTwo PEAR packages are also required for PowerAdmin: [root@Microhost]# yum -y install php-pear-DB php-pear-MDB2-Driver-mysql\nAfter the installation has been completed, Apache is started and set to start when the system boots: [root@Microhost]# systemctl enable httpd.service\n[root@Microhost]# systemctl start httpd.service\nWe can proceed and download the package of poweradmin console now that all the system requirements for PowerAdmin are done. Since /var/www/html is Apache's default web directory, the package will be downloaded there. [root@Microhost]# cd /var/www/html/\nNow we will download the packages using Wget as following [root@Microhost]# wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/poweradmin/poweradmin-2.1.7.tgz\nZip file has been downloaded now. We have to extract the zip file as following: [root@Microhost]# tar xfv poweradmin-2.1.7.tgz\nNow we will rename the directory name as poweradmin as following: [root@Microhost]# mv poweradmin-2.1.7.tgz poweradmin\nWe can now launch PowerAdmin's web installer while accessing the URL: http://IP\\_address/poweradmin/install/ The output will be shown as below: ![](images/power-1.png) The above page requires you to select the PowerAdmin language. Choose the one you want and then click on the 'Go To Step 2'. The output will be shown as below: The installer expects that you have already created the PowerDNS . ![](images/power2.png) We can move on to the next step since we have already created one. The database details you set up earlier, will be requested. Poweradmin administrator password is also necessary: ![](images/power3.png) Go to step 4 once you've entered them. You are going to create a new user with limited Poweradmin rights. You will have to enter the following fields: - Username - PowerAdmin username. - Password – The user's password. - Hostmaster – This value will be used when you create SOA records and do not have the hostmaster specified. - Primary name server- The value will be used to create new DNS zones as primary name server. - Secondary name server – The value is used to generate new DNS zones as the primary name server. ![](images/power-4.png) The next step will be to ask Poweradmin to create a new user database with limited rights in database tables. The code you need to put in a MySQL console is given below: ![](images/power-6.png) Now login to MySQL database on server using below command: [root@Microhost]# mysql -u root -p\nNow execute the code provided by the Poweadin console: [root@Microhost]# MariaDB [(none)]\u003e GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON powerdns.* TO ‘powermarin’@’localhost’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘123qweasd’;\n![](images/power-5.png) Now go to redirect to the path **/var/www/html/poweradmin/inc**. We have to create a file named **config.inc.php** using below command: [root@Microhost]# vi /var/www/html/poweradmin/inc/config.inc.php\n![](images/power-7.png) Now copy all the content of above mentioned image and paste it to file **config.inc.php** Go to the last page where the installation has been finished and you will receive information on accessing the installation of your Poweradmin. ![](images/power-8.png) URLs of other DNS providers can be activated by execution. [root@Microhost]# cp install/htaccess.dist .htaccess\nIt is important to rename or remove the install directory from the poweradmin folder: [root@Microhost]# mv /var/www/html/poweradmin/install/ /var/www/html/poweradmin/donotinstall/\nNow configuration has been successfully completed. We can access the Poweradmin using Url: http://IP_address/poweradmin/\n![](images/power9.png) After login, you can see the main page as following ![](images/mainpage.png) Now you can proceed to add Master Zone as per your requirement.

It could be the hard disc in your computer, an external hard drive, or another type of portable media like a USB drive or an SD Memory card.\nThe use of USB drives for the transfer of files is extremely common in today’s world. For those (new Linux users) who prefer to work from the command line, becoming familiar with the various methods by which a USB device name can be identified is very important when it comes time to format the device.\nAfter you have connected a device to your computer, such as a USB drive, particularly on a desktop computer, the device is automatically mounted to a specific directory, which is typically located under /media/username/device-label. You are then able to access the files contained within the device by navigating to the directory in which it is mounted. On the other hand, this is not the case while working with a server, since you will need to manually mount a device and then designate where it should be mounted.\nThe /dev directory houses specialised device files that are used by Linux to determine the identity of hardware. This directory contains a number of files, one of which is /dev/sda or /dev/hda, which represents your first master drive. Each partition will be represented by a number, such as /dev/sda1 or /dev/hda1 for the first partition, and so on for subsequent partitions.\nFollow the below steps to learn 4 Effective Ways to Determine the Name of a Plugged USB Device in Linux..","determine-the-name-of-the-usb-device-using-the-fdisk-utility#Determine the Name of the USB Device Using the fdisk Utility":"It is possible to execute fdisk with root privileges in the following manner: fdisk is a powerful application that prints out the partition table on all of your block devices, including USB drives.\n# sudo fdisk -l ","find-disk#Find Disk":" # ls /dev/vda* or\n# ls /dev* Now, let’s find out the names of the devices by utilising a variety of command-line tools, as indicated below:","find-the-name-of-a-usb-device-with-the-lsblk-command#Find the Name of a USB Device with the lsblk Command":"You can also use the lsblk command, which stands for “list block devices.” This command will list all block devices that are currently connected to your system in the following format:\n# lsblk ","using-the-df-command-get-the-name-of-the-connected-usb-device#Using the df command, get the name of the connected USB device":"The df programme, which analyses the consumption of disc space in Linux systems, can be used, as demonstrated in the following image, to view each device that is connected to your computer as well as its mount point:\n# df -h ","using-the-dmesg-command-determine-the-name-of-the-usb-device#Using the dmesg Command, Determine the Name of the USB Device":"A crucial command, dmesg, prints or controls the kernel ring buffer, a data structure that holds information about the activities of the kernel.\nTo read kernel operation messages, run the command that is listed below.

Alternatives is a program that adds, deletes, updates, and displays data on the symbolic links that make up the alternatives system.\nBecause many users don’t care how their computer completes a job as long as it is successful, abstractions may be useful to users. In reality, as long as all of an application’s system calls are properly responded, it doesn’t always matter how anything is accomplished. Theoretically, a Linux system administrator may provide a wide range of system utilities based on their functions rather than the precise name of the executable, but doing so often requires a lot of symlinking and version management. Unless you use the alternatives command, that is.\nIt’s important to note that the alternatives command first existed as a substitute. This was originally an update-alternatives convenience tool from the Debian Linux project, written in Perl. The command was rewritten by Red Hat without the use of Perl, and it has since spread across Fedora-based distributions like Red Hat and CentOS as well as other distributions that rely on Red Hat to provide the functional definition of the Linux Standard Base (LSB).","check-alternatives#Check Alternatives":"Other advantages of the alternatives command include the ability to symlink dependent components when a certain option is selected. Alternatives keeps your discrepancies consolidated while while doing a lot of the hard work. To avoid having to always remember that emacs is really emacs-26.3 or that java is actually /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.232.b09-0, etc., you may check in on what alternatives are available:\nalternatives --list Now, you have a learned the introduction of Linux alternatives command. The alternatives command is an illustration of how both users and administrators can profit from some deft manipulation since Linux is all about choice and flexibility.\nMust Read: What are Runlevels in Linux and its understanding.","creating-a-new-alternative#Creating a new alternative":"It is simple to generate an alternative entry using the example situation of an old binary named em being replaced by the new variation nem. Although in most cases this isn’t required since the command isn’t precisely what people assume it is in the first place (java, for example, is seldom found under /usr/bin directly), you must rename the original command in this example. If you do need to rename a binary, the proper place to do so is in the binary’s RPM spec file so that the command to install the RPM supplies the binary with the new name.\nIn a pinch, particularly if you’re planning to phase the command out anyway, you could remove it from the system’s package management and just maintain a customised version of the old command accessible via /opt or something like.\nTake the original editor, which you have called em2, for this example (denoting its latest version number).\nNow, you may associate two binaries (em2 and nem) with the command em. Assume that em and nem are both little Emacs-style editors to help keep the terminology distinctions clear. In that instance, for the sake of simplicity, a very general word for the new alternative would be emacs (using the symbol to signify “micro”) or uemacs.\nOffer the following as a replacement for the original:\na location for the “generic” symlink a name for the alternative (I’ve decided upon uemacs, to make it clear that it’s a reference name rather than a specific binary) the binary to be executed when these symlinks are called a priority level to indicate which alternative is preferred alternatives --install /usr/bin/em uemacs /opt/em-legacy/em2 1 Since the new binary is your preferred binary, develop a high priority replacement:\nalternatives --install /usr/bin/em uemacs /usr/local/bin/nem 99 With the help of these commands, a new symbolic link, /usr/bin/em, is created that points to /etc/alternatives/em, which in turn can point to either /opt/em-legacy/em2 or /usr/local/bin/nem. The systems administrator chose the descriptive and memorable term uemacs as the human-friendly name for this collection of alternatives at random. Using the —config option, you can select the alternate symlink’s destination:\nalternatives --config uemacs There are 2 programs which provide 'uemacs'. Selection Command ----------------------------------------------- *+ 1 /usr/local/bin/nem 2 /opt/em-legacy/em2 ","removing-an-alternative#Removing an alternative":"Alternatives may assist users or administrators move to something new or they might be long-term solutions. Using the —remove-all option and the alternative’s “generic” name will eliminate all alternatives if you need to for whatever reason. Uemacs is used as an example here:\nalternatives --remove-all uemacs This deletes the symlink in /usr/bin and /etc/alternatives as well as everything else related to uemacs from the alternatives subsystem. Use the —remove option with the alternative name (in this case, uemacs) and the path of the choice you wish to drop if you only want to remove one option from an alternative:\nalternatives --remove uemacs /opt/em-legacy/em2 ","when-to-use-the-alternatives-command#When to use the alternatives command":"An easy-to-understand and practical example is the em command on your computer, which starts a simple text editor. It has long been the editor of choice for your user base; many individuals have built processes around it, and some people keep very specific configurations for it. Although em doesn’t support Unicode, your user base lately made it apparent to you that they can’t function without emoji functionality in their terminal editors.\nYou discover nem, a Unicode-capable branch of em, but you are aware that 99% of your customers are already used to em, have scripts that call em, and will never stop thinking of any alternative programme as em. The simple answer to this problem, as well as many others like it, is to provide the new nem binary as the preferred substitute for the em binary whenever the em command is used.\nAlthough manually constructing a symlink could seem alluring, it is neither centralised nor immune to changes from a package management.\nWhen handling “generic” application names, the alternatives command is most helpful. As “generic” isn’t usually generic in the UNIX world, just as “Kleenex” or “Xerox” isn’t always generic in the actual world, terminology like java, (x)emacs(-nox), (n)vi(m), whois, and iptables are often among of the first to have replacements specified for them. The alternatives command is not seen as a suitable option for really general names, such as EDITOR and CC. Because they are environment variables and need to be specified in /etc or $HOME/.profile, those phrases."},"title":"An introduction to the Linux alternatives command"},"/docs/linux/apache-virtual-hosts-setup-on-centos-7/":{"data":{"":"","create-new-virtual-host-files#Create New Virtual Host Files":"This is the virtual host file to specify how the Apache web server is to answer the various domain requests and how our separate websites are configured.\nIn order for us to start by setting the directory in which our virtual hosts are saved, and the directory in which Apache is told that the virtual host is ready to serve visitors.

It serves over half of all active websites in the Internet and is extremely powerful and flexible.\nApache divides its features and components into separate units, which can be independently customized and set up. A virtual Host is called the basic unit describing a single site or domain. Virtual hosts allow one server, through a matching system, to host several domains or interfaces. This is important for those who want to host more than one VPS site.\nEach configured domain will direct the visitor to a certain directory that contains information on this website without indicating that the same server is also responsible for other websites. This scheme can be expanded without software limits provided the traffic of all the sites is handled by your server.","prerequisites#Prerequisites":" Log in to the server with the ssh.

SSL Maintenance and TroubleshootingOnce you’ve installed a Let’s Encrypt certificate on your Ubuntu Certbot setup, you can check your website’s SSL status at https://WhyNoPadlock.com. This will help you detect any mixed content errors.\nThe certificate files for each domain are stored in:\ncd /etc/letsencrypt/live Let’s Encrypt certificates have a lifespan of 90 days. To avoid expiration, Certbot automatically monitors SSL status twice daily and renews certificates expiring within thirty days. You can review settings using Systemd or cron.d.\nsystemctl show certbot.timer cat /etc/cron.d/certbot Verify that the renewal process functions correctly:\nsudo certbot renew --dry-run Simply having an SSL certificate and implementing 301 redirects to enforce HTTPS may not always suffice to thwart hacks. Cyber attackers have devised methods to circumvent both security measures, potentially compromising server communications.\nHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security HTTP header designed to counteract this by instructing web browsers to serve your website only when a valid SSL certificate is received. If the browser encounters an insecure connection, it outright rejects the data, safeguarding the user.\nConfiguring HSTS within your web server, is straightforward and enhances security significantly."},"title":"Configure Let's Encrypt SSL on Ubuntu with Certbot"},"/docs/linux/convert-rwx-permissions-to-octal-format-in-linux/":{"data":{"":"\nDescription\nYou could find that displaying the access rights of files and directories in octal form rather to the more common rwx format is more helpful at times, or you might decide that you want to show both forms.\nStat is a software that shows the status of files or filesystems and is included in the majority of recent Linux distributions, if not all of them. This utility may be used in place of the good old ls -l command.\nWhen called without any parameters but followed by the name of a specific file, the stat command will provide a significant amount of information on the directory or file. You are able to define an output format when using the stat command in conjunction with the -c option. This specific alternative is the one that piques our attention the most at the moment.\nType the following command to show all of the files in the current working directory, followed by their access privileges in octal format:\n# stat -c '%n %a' * The following is the format sequence for the aforementioned command:\n%n denotes the file name. %a denotes access rights in octal form. If you want to display the permissions in rwx format in addition, you have the alternative option of appending %a to %A, which is the parameter that is supplied to stat.\nIn that instance, simply type:\n# stat -c '%n %A' * You can include the %F format sequence in order to see the file type shown in the output.\n# stat -c '%c %F %a' You are able to specify a number of additional format sequences as well; for a full list of them, please refer to the stat man page.\n# man stat Conclusion\nWe have gone over the essential Linux programme known as stat, which allows you to display the status of a file or file system. The conversion of the rwx access rights from the standard output of ls -l into octal format was the primary focus of our efforts here.\nAs I had indicated previously, many contemporary editions of Linux now come with the stat utility already installed. You should also keep in mind that your shell might already come pre-installed with its own version of stat. As a result, you should consult the documentation that comes packaged with your shell for additional information regarding the available options and how to make use of them.\nThank You"},"title":"convert rwx permissions to octal format in Linux"},"/docs/linux/create-a-new-user-in-mysql-and-learn-how-to-grant-permissions/":{"data":{"":"\nIntroduction\nIn this article we will learn How To Create a New User and Grant Permissions in MySQL..\nMySQL is open-source RDBMS. As of this writing, it’s the most popular open-source database in the world and part of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP).\nThis guide explains how to create a MySQL user and grant permissions.\nFollo the below steps to Create a New User and Grant Permissions in MySQL..\nPrerequisites\nYou’ll need MySQL to follow this guide. This guide assumes the database is on a VPS running Ubuntu 20.04, but the principles it outlines should apply regardless of how you access your database.\nIf you don’t have a MySQL database and want to set one up yourself, see our How To Install MySQL guide. The methods for creating a new MySQL user and granting permissions are generally the same regardless of your server’s operating system.","making-a-new-user#Making a New User":"MySQL creates a root user account for database management during installation. This user has full control over the MySQL server’s databases, tables, users, etc. This account should only be used for administrative purposes. This step shows how to use the root MySQL user to create a new user account.\nIn Ubuntu systems running MySQL 5.7 (and later), the root MySQL user authenticates with the auth socket plugin by default. This plugin requires that the operating system user who invokes MySQL match the command’s MySQL user. This means you must use sudo with the mysql command to access the root MySQL user.\n#sudo mysql Note: If your root MySQL user has a password, use a different command to access the MySQL shell. The following will run your MySQL client with regular user privileges; you’ll only gain administrator privileges by entering a password.\n#mysql -u root -p From the MySQL prompt, you can create a new user with CREATE USER. The syntax is as follows:\nmysql\u003e #CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_plugin BY 'password'; After CREATE USER, set a username. It’s followed by a @ sign and the hostname from which the user will connect. If you only plan to access this user locally, use localhost. Username and host should be enclosed in single quotes to avoid errors.\nYou can choose an authentication plugin for your user. The auth socket plugin provides strong security without requiring a password from valid users. But it prevents remote connections, which can complicate external programme interactions with MySQL.\nYou can omit WITH authentication plugin to use MySQL’s default plugin, caching sha2 password. MySQL recommends this plugin for users who want to log in with a password due to its strong security.\nRun the command to create a caching sha2 password user. Replace sammy with your preferred username and password.\nmysql\u003e #CREATE USER 'microhost'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; Note:There’s a known issue with some versions of PHP and caching sha2 password. If you plan to use this database with phpMyAdmin, create a user that uses the older, but still secure, mysql native password plugin instead.\nmysql\u003e #CREATE USER 'microhost'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password'; If you’re unsure, create a user that authenticates with caching sha2 plugin and then ALTER it with this command.\nmysql\u003e #ALTER USER 'microhost'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password'; You can grant a new user privileges after creating them.","providing-authorization-to-a-user#Providing Authorization to a User":"Syntax for granting user privileges:\nmysql\u003e # GRANT PRIVILEGE ON database.table TO 'username'@'host'; PRIVILEGE in this example syntax defines what actions the user can perform on the specified database and table. You can grant multiple privileges to the same user with one command. You can also grant a user global privileges by entering * for database and table names. SQL asterisks represent “all” databases or tables.\nFor example, the following command grants a user global privileges to CREATE, ALTER, and DROP databases, tables, and users, as well as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data from any table on the server. The user can also query data with SELECT, create foreign keys with REFERENCES, and perform FLUSH operations with RELOAD. You should only give users the permissions they need, so feel free to adjust your own user’s privileges.\nMySQL documentation lists all available privileges.\nRun this GRANT statement, substituting your MySQL user’s name for microhost:\nmysql\u003e #GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'microhost'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION; With GRANT OPTION is also included. This lets your MySQL user grant permissions to other users.\nWarning: Some users may want to grant their MySQL user ALL PRIVILEGES, which will give them broad superuser privileges like root’s.\nmysql\u003e #GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'microhost'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION; Such broad privileges should not be granted lightly, as this MySQL user will have access to every server database.\nMany guides suggest running FLUSH PRIVILEGES after a CREATE USER or GRANT statement to reload the grant tables and ensure new privileges take effect.\nmysql\u003e #FLUSH PRIVILEGES; According to the MySQL documentation, when you modify the grant tables indirectly with an account management statement like GRANT, the database reloads the grant tables immediately into memory, so we don’t need FLUSH PRIVILEGES. Using it won’t harm the system.\nRevoking permission is similar to granting it:\nmysql\u003e #REVOKE type_of_permission ON database_name.table_name FROM 'username'@'host'; To revoke permissions, use FROM instead of TO.\nRun SHOW GRANTS to see a user’s current permissions.\nmysql\u003e #SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'host'; Just as DROP deletes databases, it deletes users.\nmysql\u003e #DROP USER 'username'@'localhost'; After creating a MySQL user and granting privileges, exit the client:\nmysql\u003e #exit To log in as your new MySQL user, type:\nmysql\u003e #mysql -u microhost -p The -p flag prompts MySQL for your password to authenticate.\nHopefully you have understood all the steps carefully to Create a New User and Grant Permissions in MySQL ..\nMust read:- https://utho.com/docs/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-with-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu-14-04/\nThankyou"},"title":"How To Create a New User and Grant Permissions in MySQL"},"/docs/linux/create-a-zabbix-action-to-deliver-an-alert-message-to-the-user/":{"data":{"":"\nDescription\nCreate a Zabbix action to deliver an alert message to the user. zabbix is a free and open-source monitoring software application for various IT components such as networks, servers, virtual machines (VMs), and cloud services.

Selinux was integrated in 2003 with linux kernel it also ships with most of the Linux distributions.\nThe standard access policy based on the users, groups, and other permissions, known as Discretionary Access Control (DAC). However, SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC).\nDiscretionary access control (DAC) does not enable system administrators to develop detailed and fine-grained security policies, such as limiting existing applications to viewing only log files, while allowing additional applications to add new data to log files Mandatory Access Control (MAC) act upon SELinux context. This security policy is centrally controlled by a security policy administrator, users do not have the ability to override the policy even if they have root privileges. Ideally, it should be trusted by the person with root access. However, if safety was affected, the system was affected too. SELinux and MACs solve this problem both by confining preferential processes and by automating the creation of security policies.\nSELinux denies anything not explicitly permitted by default. SELinux has two global modes, Enforcement and Permissive modes. Permissive mode enables the system to operate as a discretionary access control system while logging any SELinux violation. The mode of enforcement imposes a strict denial of access to anything not explicitly permitted. You, as the system administrator, must write policies to specifically allow certain behavior on a machine.\n[ht_message mstyle=“alert” title=“NOTE” \" show_icon=“true” id=\"\" class=““style=”” ]You are not advised to disable SELinux.

It serves over half of all active websites in the Internet and is extremely powerful and flexible.\nApache divides its features and components into separate units, which can be independently customized and set up. A virtual Host is called the basic unit describing a single site or domain. Virtual hosts allow one server, through a matching system, to host several domains or interfaces. This is important for those who want to host more than one VPS site.\nEach configured domain will direct the visitor to a certain directory that contains information on this website without indicating that the same server is also responsible for other websites. This scheme can be expanded without software limits provided the traffic of all the sites is handled by your server.\n*To modify the document root of Apache, you must alter the files apache2.conf and 000-default.conf.\nApache is installed in the /var/www/html directory.\nThis is the default Apache root directory.\nEither modify the Apache root directory or relocate the project to /var/www/html.\nTo change apache2 web folder follow below steps……\nStep.1 access putty\nStep.2 .To change Apache’s root directory\n#cd /etc/apache2/sites-available Step.3 Then open the 000-default.conf file\n#vi 000-default.conf Step.4 Edit the DocumentRoot option mentioned at the above screenshot.\nDocumentRoot /var/www/my/html/change folder.\nStep.5 Then restart the apache server:\n#sudo service apache2 restart I am hoping that you are familiar with how to alter the apache2 web folder.\nThankyou\nMust Read : 4 Effective Ways to Determine the Name of a Plugged USB Device in Linux"},"title":"How to change apache2 web folder in Ubuntu"},"/docs/linux/how-to-change-date-and-time-in-linux/":{"data":{"":" How to change date and time in Linux\nDescription\nIn this post, we will explore How to change date and time in Linux and the various options available to us in Linux for modifying the current date and time.

We need to enter passwords in order to access a variety of items, including computers, email, the cloud, our phones, and numerous documents. The basics of picking a password that is easy to recall yet difficult to decipher are something that all of us are acquainted with. What about a machine-based password generator that takes care of everything for you and does it automatically? When I tell that Linux is extremely exceptional at achieving this, I ask that you trust me and accept my word for it.\nFollo the below steps to How to Create, Encrypt, and Decrypt Random Passwords in Linux..\nUsing the ‘pwgen’ command, generate a random, one-of-a-kind password with a length equal to ten characters. If you have not yet installed pwgen, you may download it by using either Apt or YUM. # pwgen 10 1 Produce a number of random and unique passwords with a length of 50 characters all in one go!\n# pwgen 50 You may use the’makepasswd’ command to create a random, one-of-a-kind password of a specific length according to your preferences. Make sure that the makepasswd command has been installed on your system before you attempt to run it. If not! It is recommended that you use Apt or YUM to install the’makepasswd’ package.\nProduce a password that is completely random and has a length of 10 characters. Default Value is 10.\n# mkpasswd Create a password that is completely random and has a length of 50 characters.\n# mkpasswd Crypt, in conjunction with salt, should be used to encrypt a password. Salt should be made available both manually and automatically.\nFor the benefit of people who aren’t familiar with salt:\nSalt is a kind of random data that is used as an extra input to one-way functions with the purpose of preventing passwords from being cracked via dictionary attacks.\nBefore moving on, check to verify that the mkpasswd package has been successfully installed.\nThe password will be encrypted using salt if you run the command below. The value of the salt is determined in a manner that is both random and mechanical. Therefore, the output will be different each time you run the command below since it accepts a random value for salt each time. As a result of this, running the command below will always provide different results.\n# mkpasswd microhost Conclusion One of the key issues that must be addressed in this day and age of sophisticated digital technology is that of safety.

In the event that you delete one file, one link to the file’s underlying inode will be removed. In contrast, a symbolic link, which may also be referred to as a soft link, is a link that points to the name of another file located inside the filesystem.\n**Note:**The fact that hard links can only be used inside the same filesystem is another significant distinction between the two kinds of connections. Symbolic links, on the other hand, may be used across a variety of filesystems.\nHow to Create Hard Links #ls -l *Create hard link\n#ln source filename create hardlink file How to Create Symbolic Links #ln -s source.file linkfile *ln creates hard links by default.\n*-s creates a soft link.\n*-f overwrites an existing file.\nSource is the referenced file or directory.\nIf Destination is blank, the link is saved in the current working directory.\nDeleting or Removing Links #rm linkfile name #unlink linkfile name Hard Links vs. Soft Links\nThe following are the two categories of connections that can be created with the ln command:\nSoft links\nHard Links\nSoft( symbolik)Links\nA soft link, also known as a symbolic link or symlink, directs users to the path or location of the original file. On the internet, it operates much like a hyperlink.\nHere are some crucial features of a soft link:\nThe original data is still there even if the symbolic link file is removed.\nThe symbolic link will not operate if the original file is relocated or removed.\nA file on a separate file system may be referenced using a soft link.\nTo easily access a commonly used file without inputting the whole address, soft links are widely utilised.\nHard Links\nWhen a file is saved to a hard disc, the following occur:\nThe data is written physically to the disc.\nA reference file, calledinode, is generated to indicate where the data is stored.\nCreating a filename to relate to the inode data.\nA hard link operates by establishing a new filename that relates to the original file’s inode data. In practise, this is equivalent to duplicating the file.\nHere are few essential features of hard links:\nIf the original file is erased, the data of the file may still be accessible through hard links.\nIf the original file is transferred, hard links continue to function.\nOnly files on the same file system may be referenced by a hard link.\nWhen the number of hard links is zero, the inode and file contents are permanently erased.\nThank You","how-to-create-hard-links#\u003cstrong\u003eHow to Create Hard Links\u003c/strong\u003e":"","how-to-create-symbolic-links#\u003cstrong\u003eHow to Create Symbolic Links\u003c/strong\u003e":""},"title":"How to Create Hard and Symbolic Links"},"/docs/linux/how-to-create-temporary-and-permanent-redirects-with-apache/":{"data":{"":"","analyzing-redirect-methods#Analyzing Redirect Methods":"Redirects can be used in many ways. If you already have a website and want to change your domain, you shouldn’t just give up on your old domain. If the content on your site disappears without telling the browser where it is now, bookmarks and links to your site from other pages on the internet will stop working. If you change domains without redirecting, you’ll lose traffic from people who used to visit your site and all the credibility you’ve worked hard to build.\nOften, it’s a good idea to register multiple versions of a name so that people who type in addresses that look like your main domain can find you. For example, if you have a domain called myspiders.com, you could also buy the domain names for myspiders.net and myspiders.org and point them both to your myspiders.com site. This lets you catch people who might be typing in the wrong address to get to your site. It can also stop another site from using a similar domain name and making money off of your online presence.\nSometimes, you need to change the names of pages on your site that have already been published and gotten traffic. In most cases, this would lead to a 404 Not Found error or, depending on your security settings, another error. You can avoid these by sending your visitors to a different page that has the right information they were looking for. There are a few different kinds of URL redirects, and each one tells the client browser something different. 302 temporary redirects and 301 permanent redirects are the most common.\nTemporary Redirects Temporary redirects are useful if you need to serve the web content for a certain URL from a different place for a short time. For example, if you are doing maintenance on your site, you may need to use a temporary redirect to send all of your domain’s pages to a page explaining that you will be back soon.\nTemporary redirects tell the browser that the content is temporarily at a different location, but that the original URL should still be tried.\nPermanent Redirects Permanent redirects are useful when your content has been moved to a new location forever.\nThis is useful for when you need to change domains or when the URL needs to change for other reasons and the old location will no longer be used. This redirect informs the browser that it should no longer request the old URL and should update its information to point to the new URL\nForcing SSL One common way to use redirects is to tell all traffic to a site to use SSL instead of HTTP.\nYou can make all requests for http://www.example.com go to https://www.example.com by using redirects.\nHow to Redirect in Apache Apache has a few tools that it can use to redirect. Tools from the mod alias module can be used to set up simple redirects, and the mod rewrite module can be used to set up more complex redirects.\nUsing the Redirect Directive With Apache, you can use the “Redirect” directive, which is part of the mod alias module and is turned on by default, to redirect a single page. At least two arguments are needed for this directive: the old URL and the new URL.\nApache server blocks can be saved in the main Apache settings file in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, but it’s easier to manage if you make a new file for each configuration in /etc/apache2/sites-available/. As you turn files on or off, Apache creates symbolic links (shortcuts) from files in sites-available/ to files in another folder called sites-available/. By default, Apache is installed with a single site-specific configuration in /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf that is enabled and linked to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf.\nvi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf By default, it contains a standard web server configuration that will listen on port 80 and look for an index.html file located in /var/www/html on your system.\nIf you instead needed to send requests for domain1.com to domain2.com, you could remove the existing directives from this server block and replace them with a permanent redirect:\nThis tells the browser that any requests for www.domain1.com should be sent to www.domain2.com. This only applies to one page, not the whole site.\nBy default, the Redirect directive sets up a temporary redirect called a 302. If you want to make a permanent redirect, you can do it in either of the two ways below:\nMethod 1:\nvi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf \u003cVirtualHost *:80\u003e ServerName www.domain1.com Redirect 301 /oldlocation http://www.domain2.com/newlocation \u003c/VirtualHost\u003e Method 2:\nvi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf \u003cVirtualHost *:80\u003e ServerName www.domain1.com Redirect permanent /oldlocation http://www.domain2.com/newlocation \u003c/VirtualHost\u003e Using the RedirectMatch Directive You can redirect more than one page by using the RedirectMatch directive, which lets you use regular expressions to set up patterns that match directories.\nThis will allow you to redirect entire directories instead of just single files.\nRedirectMatch looks for patterns in parentheses and then uses “$1”, where “1” is the first group of text, to refer to the matched text in the redirect. Numbers are given in order to the next groups.\nFor example, if you wanted to match every request for something within the /images directory to a subdomain named images.example.com, you could use the following:\nvi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default \u003cVirtualHost *:80\u003e … RedirectMatch ^/images/(.*)$ http://images.example.com/$1 … \u003c/VirtualHost\u003e As with the Redirect directive, you can choose the type of redirect by putting the redirect code before the URL location rules.\nYou’ll need to restart Apache for your changes to take effect. This can be done with systemctl on a new Ubuntu server:\nsystemctl restart apache2 Using mod_rewrite to Redirect The mod rewrite module is the most flexible way to set up redirect rules, but it is also the most complicated. How to Rewrite URLs with mod rewrite for Apache has more information about how to work with mod rewrite.","introduction#Introduction":"HTTP redirection, also called URL redirection, is a way to send a domain or address to a different one. There are many ways to use redirection, and there are a few different kinds to think about. Redirects are used when a website needs to send people who type in one address to a different one.\nAs you make content and manage servers, you will often need to send traffic from one place to another. This guide will talk about how these techniques can be used and how to do them in Apache and Nginx, which are the two most popular web servers.","prerequisites#Prerequisites":" An Ubuntu 20.04 server set up A super user or any normal user with SUDO privileges.

Some of them are hidden files, some are maintained in a different folder that was made just for our convenience, while others are left as they are. However, all of this information fills up our folders, most often the desktop, making it appear like a jumbled mess. But we run into an issue when we need to search this massive collection for a certain file that was edited at a specific date and time, and that file may be everywhere.\nThose who are accustomed to working with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) can locate it by using File Manager, which lists files in a long listing format, which makes it simple to determine what we were looking for. On the other hand, users who are accustomed to working with black screens, as well as anyone who works on servers that do not have GUIs, would want a straightforward command or set of commands that could make their search simpler.\nThe true power and flexibility of Linux is on display here, as the operating system comes with a set of commands that, when utilised singly or in conjunction with one another, can assist in the search for a file or the sorting of a collection of files according to their name, date of modification, time of creation, or even any filter that can be imagined being applied in order to obtain the desired result.\nIn this section, we will demonstrate the true power of Linux by analysing a group of commands that may assist in the sorting of a file or even a series of files according to the date and time that they were created.\nSorting Files in Linux using Linux Utilities The following are some examples of fundamental Linux command line tools that are enough for sorting a directory according to the date and time:\nls command:- Listing the contents of the directory, this application may display the files and directories and can even provide all of the status information about them, such as the date and time of the most recent access or change, permissions, size, owner, and group, among other things.\nsort command sort:- Using this command, you are able to sort the results of any search simply based on any field or any individual column of the field.\nIf you operate on dark screens and have to sort through a large number of files in order to get the one you want, you will find that these commands, in and of themselves, are quite powerful skills to acquire.\nVarious Methods for Classifying Documents Based on Date and Time\nYou can find a list of instructions to sort based on date and time below.\nCreate a list of files based on the most recent modification time. The following command will display the files in a long listing style and will order the files based on the most recent modification time. To sort in the other direction, use the ‘-r’ option in conjunction with this command.\n# ls -lt List Files According to Last Access Time Listing of files in directory based on last access time, that is, listing of files based on the time the file was last accessed rather than the time the file was last edited.\n# ls -ltu List Files According to Last Modification Time The ‘ctime’ is a listing of files in the directory that is based on the most recent modification time of the file’s status information. The first file that is shown by this command is the one whose status information, including the owner, group, permissions, and size, has been modified within the last several minutes.\n# ls -ltc With the ‘-a’ choice, the above commands may list and sort even hidden files in the current directory, while the ‘-r’ switch shows the result in reverse order.\nFor more in-depth sorting, such as sorting on the result of the search command, ls may also be used, but’sort’ is more useful since the output may include more than just the file name.\nThe following lines demonstrate how to use the sort command in conjunction with the find command to sort a list of files based on Date and Time.\nSorting Files by Month In this case, we use the search command to locate all of the files in the root (’/’) directory, and we then report the result in the following order: the month in which the file was accessed, followed by the filename.\n# find / -type f -printf \"n%Ab %p\" | head -n 5 The following command sorts the output with the key as the first field, as supplied by the ‘-k1’ parameter, and then it sorts on the month, as specified by the ‘M’ parameter that comes before it.\n# find / -type f -printf \"n%Ab %p\" | head -n 5 | sort -k1M ![output](images/image-390.png) ## **Sorting Files by Date** Here, we use the search command once again to locate all of the files in the root directory; however, this time, we will output the results in the following order: filename, last date the file was accessed, and then last time the file was accessed. [console]# find / -type f -printf \"n%AD %AT %p\" | head -n 5 The sort command that follows first sorts on the basis of the last digit of the year, then sorts on the basis of the final digit of the month in the opposite order, and finally sorts on the basis of the first field. In this case, “1.8” refers to the eighth column of the first field, and the letter “n” that comes before it indicates that the data is being sorted numerically. The letter “r” indicates that the data is being sorted in reverse order.\n# find / -type f -printf \"n%AD %AT %p\" | head -n 11 | sort -k1.8n -k1.1nr -k1 Sorting Files by Date Here, we use the find command again to list the top 5 files in the root directory. The result is printed in the format “last time file was accessed, then filename.”\n# find / -type f -printf \"n%AT %p\" | head -n 11 The following command arranges the data based on the first column of the first field, which is the first digit of the hour.\n# find / -type f -printf \"n%AT %p\" | head -n 11 | sort -k1.1n Sorting ls -l output by date The output of the ’ls -l’ command is sorted by this command based on the 6th field in the month-wise order, then based on the 7th field, which is the date, in the numerical order.\n# ls -l | sort -k6M -k7n Conclusion In a similar vein, if you have a working grasp of the sort command, you may sort practically any listing according to any field, as well as any column of that listing. These are some tips that might assist you in sorting files depending on the date or time they were created. You are able to have your own own techniques built on top of them.","create-a-list-of-files-based-on-the-most-recent-modification-time#\u003cstrong\u003eCreate a list of files based on the most recent modification time.\u003c/strong\u003e":"","list-files-according-to-last-access-time#\u003cstrong\u003eList Files According to Last Access Time\u003c/strong\u003e":"","list-files-according-to-last-modification-time#\u003cstrong\u003eList Files According to Last Modification Time\u003c/strong\u003e":"","sort-command#\u003cstrong\u003esort command\u003c/strong\u003e":"","sorting-files-by-date#\u003cstrong\u003eSorting Files by Date\u003c/strong\u003e":"","sorting-files-by-month#\u003cstrong\u003eSorting Files by Month\u003c/strong\u003e":"","sorting-files-in-linux-using-linux-utilities#\u003cstrong\u003eSorting Files in Linux using Linux Utilities\u003c/strong\u003e":"","sorting-ls--l-output-by-date#\u003cstrong\u003eSorting ls -l output by date\u003c/strong\u003e":""},"title":"How to Find and Sort Files in Linux Based on Modification Date and Time"},"/docs/linux/how-to-fix-command-not-found-error-in-centos/":{"data":{"":"\nNew Linux or Unix users often ask this. “Command not found” means Linux or UNIX looked everywhere for that application but couldn’t find it.

Data dumps can be used to backup and restore your information. They are also useful for migrating data to a new server or development environment.\nIn this tutorial, you will work with MySQL or MariaDB database dumps (the commands are interchangeable). You will specifically export a database and then import that database from the dump file.\nPrerequisites\nYou will need the following tools to import or export a MySQL or MariaDB database:\n*A virtual machine with a sudo user that is not root. If you require a server, visit this page to create a microhost Droplet running your preferred Linux distribution. Following creation, select your distribution from this list and proceed with our Initial Server Setup Guide.\n*MySQL or MariaDB must be installed. Follow our How To Install MySQL tutorial to install MySQL. Follow our How To Install MariaDB tutorial to get started.\n*In your database server, create a sample database. To make one, go to “Creating a Sample Database” in our “An Introduction to Queries in MySQL” tutorial.\nNote: Instead of manually installing MySQL, you can use the DigitalOcean Marketplace’s MySQL One-Click Application.\nStep-1 The First Step — Exporting a MySQL or MariaDB Database\nThe console utility mysqldump exports databases to SQL text files. This facilitates the transfer and relocation of databases. You will need the name of your database as well as credentials for an account with at least full read-only access to the database.\nTo export your database, use mysqldump:\n#mysqldump -u username -p database_name \u003e data-dump.sql _username is the username with which you can access the database.\n_The database to export is called database name.\n*The output is stored in the data-dump.sql file located in the current directory.\nAlthough the command won’t output anything visually, you can examine the contents of data-dump.sql to determine whether it’s a genuine SQL dump file.\nRun the command line:\n#head -n 5 data-dump.sql The top of the file should look like this, with a MySQL dump for the database database name.\nSQL dump fragment -- MySQL dump 10.13 Distrib 5.7.16, for Linux (x86_64) -- -- Host: localhost Database: database_name -- ------------------------------------------------------ -- Server version 5.7.16-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 Mysqldump will print any errors to the screen if they arise during the export procedure.\nStep 2 — Importing a MySQL or MariaDB Database\nYou must build a new database if you want to import an existing dump file into MySQL or MariaDB. The imported data will be stored in this database.\nIn order to create new databases, you must first log into MySQL as root or another user who has the necessary rights:\n#mysql -u root -p This command will launch the MySQL shell prompt. Then, run the following command to create a new database. The new database in this example is called new database:\nmysql\u003e #CREATE DATABASE new_database; This result verifies the construction of the database.\nOutput Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) Then, using CTRL+D, exit the MySQL shell. You can import the dump file from the command line using the following command:\n#mysql -u username -p new_database \u003c data-dump.sql _username is the username with which you can access the database.\n_The newly established database is known by the name newdatabase.\n*The data dump file to be imported is called data-dump.sql, and it can be found in the current directory.\nIf the command is executed successfully, no output is produced. If any errors arise during the process, mysql will instead print them to the terminal. Log in to the MySQL shell and inspect the data to see if the import was successful.

The logical storage volumes that are made can be made bigger or smaller depending on how much storage you need.\nFor this feature to work, it’s important to remember that the filesystem itself must support resizing. The EXT2, 3, and 4 filesystems all let you change the size of a filesystem both offline (when the filesystem is not mounted) and online (when the filesystem is mounted).

It was made with Python and jQuery, and it has all of the features of PostgreSQL. You can do everything with pgAdmin, from writing simple SQL queries to keeping an eye on your databases and setting up more complex database architectures.\nPrerequisites A super user( root ) or any normal user with SUDO privileges. Configured Nginx reverse proxy for http://unix:/tmp/pgadmin4.sock. PostgreSQL installed on your server. Python 3 and venv installed on your server. Read here for more information about this. 1. Installing pgAdmin and its Dependencies Step 1: As of this writing, pgAdmin 4 is the most recent version, while pgAdmin 3 is the most recent version that can be found in the official Ubuntu repositories. But pgAdmin 3 is no longer supported, and the people who run the project suggest that you use pgAdmin 4. In this step, we’ll talk about how to install the latest version of pgAdmin 4 in a virtual environment (which is what the project’s development team recommends) and how to use apt to install its dependencies.\napt update Step 2: Next, you need to install the following. These include libgmp3-dev, which is a library for multiprecision arithmetic, libpq-dev, which has header files and a static library that make it easier to talk to a PostgreSQL backend, and so on.\napt install libgmp3-dev libpq-dev Following this, create a few directories where pgAdmin will store its sessions data, storage data, and logs:\nmkdir -p /var/lib/pgadmin4/sessions mkdir /var/lib/pgadmin4/storage mkdir /var/log/pgadmin4 Step 3: Then, change who owns these directories to your user and group that is not root. This is necessary because they are currently owned by your root user, but we will install pgAdmin from a virtual environment owned by your non-root user, and the installation process involves creating some files in these directories. After the installation, we will change the ownership to the www-data user and group so that it can be served to the web:\nNext, open up your virtual environment. Find the directory where your programming environment is and then turn it on. We’ll go to the environments directory and turn on the my env environment by using the same naming rules as the prerequisite Python 3 tutorial:\ncd environments/ source my_env/bin/activate Step 4: After turning on the virtual environment, it would be smart to make sure that your system has the most recent version of pip. Run the following command to bring pip up to the latest version:\npython -m pip install -U pip Step 5: Now install pgadmin using python\npython -m pip install pgadmin4==6.10 Step 6: Next, install Gunicorn, a Python WSGI server that will be used with Nginx to serve the pgadmin web interface later in the tutorial:\npython -m pip install gunicorn That’s all there is to installing pgAdmin and the things it needs. Before you can connect it to your database, you’ll need to make a few changes to how the programme is set up.\n2\\. Configuring pgAdmin 4 Even though pgAdmin has been installed on your server, you still need to take a few steps to make sure it has the permissions and settings it needs to serve the web interface correctly.\nThe main configuration file for pgAdmin, config.py, is read before any other file. Its contents can be used as a guide for other configuration settings that can be set in pgAdmin’s other config files, but you shouldn’t change the config.py file itself to avoid unexpected errors. We’ll make some changes to the configuration in a new file called config local.py. This file will be read after the main one.\nStep 7 Create this file now using your preferred text editor. Here, we will use vi\nvi my_env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pgadmin4/config_local.py In your editor, add the following content:\nLOG_FILE = '/var/log/pgadmin4/pgadmin4.log' SQLITE_PATH = '/var/lib/pgadmin4/pgadmin4.db' SESSION_DB_PATH = '/var/lib/pgadmin4/sessions' STORAGE_DIR = '/var/lib/pgadmin4/storage' SERVER_MODE = True Notice that each of these file paths point to the directories you created in Step 1.\nAnd now save the file and exit.\nStep 8: With those configurations in place, run the pgAdmin setup script to set your login credentials:\npython my_env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pgadmin4/setup.py After you run this command, you will see a prompt asking for your email address and a password. When you access pgAdmin later, these will be your login information, so make sure to remember or write down what you put here:\nAfter that, pgAdmin is all set up. But your server isn’t yet serving the programme, so it’s still not available. To fix this, we will set up Gunicorn and Nginx to serve pgAdmin so that you can use a web browser to get to its user interface.\nStarting Gunicorn and Configuring Nginx Gunicorn will be used to make pgAdmin work as a web application. But since Gunicorn is an application server, it can only be used locally and can’t be accessed over the internet. You will need to use Nginx as a reverse proxy to make it available from afar.\nAfter you’ve done what you needed to do to set up Nginx as a reverse proxy, this will be in your Nginx configuration file:\nThis reverse proxy configuration makes it possible for your local browser to connect to your Gunicorn server. With the pgAdmin programme, you can start up your Gunicorn server:\nvi gunicorn --bind unix:/tmp/pgadmin4.sock --workers=1 --threads=25 --chdir ~/environments/my_env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pgadmin4 pgAdmin4:app With Gunicorn as an application server and your Nginx reverse proxy making it possible to access it, you can now use your web browser to access pgAdmin.\n4\\.

Additionally, it is essential to link the database to the same computer as the rest of the system.\nLet’s say you wish to make it possible for other distant connections to establish a connection to Redis. In this scenario, you will need to adjust the configuration of “Redis” so that it listens to addresses other than the localhost:\nIn order to accomplish this, we will access the configuration file for Redis by using the vi editor to execute the following command:\n# vi /etc/redis/redis.conf Locate the line in the file that begins with “bind” and replace it with the line that is seen in the figure:\nStep 3: Change the password for Redis. Look for the line that says “requirepass” in the file “/etc/redis/redis.conf” and then write your password in front of it:\nIn order for the modifications to take effect, the “Redis” server must be restarted.\n# systemctl restart redis-server Step 4: Check that the Changes were Made Check that Redis is still listening on port “6379” after you’ve made the adjustments described above:\n# ss -an | grep 6379 After this, all TCP traffic should be permitted to pass through port “6379”:\n# ufw allow 6379/tcp Step 5: You can get the Redis CLI here Now that all of the configurations have been finalised, run the following command to access the “Redis CLI”:\n# redis-cli Authorise your identity by using the “AUTH” keyword in the configuration file, along with the password that you set in previous steps (step 3):\n# AUTH \u003cpassword\u003e Ping the Redis to ensure that it is operating properly:\n# ping Use the following command to exit the Redis Command Line Interface:\n# quit ","installation-of-redis#Installation of Redis":"Before downloading any package from the default repository, it is recommended that the operating system be brought up to date first:\n# apt update Use the command that is mentioned below in the following manner in order to install the most recent version of Redis-server from Ubuntu’s repository:\n# apt install redis-server -y Check the status of the “Redis” server using the following command to determine whether or not the installation was successful:\n# systemctl status redis-server In order to verify that the installation was successful, we will use the following command to check the version of Redis:\n# redis-server -v ","introduction#Introduction":"In this article, you will learn how to install and configure Redis on Ubuntu 22.04.\nRedis is a data structure that is stored in memory and functions similarly to a store.

These could be small shell scripts, Node.js apps, or large packages.\nMost of the time, external packages come with a unit file that lets an init system like systemd handle them, or they come as docker images that a container engine can handle. But a lightweight alternative is helpful for software that isn’t well-packaged or for users who don’t want to interact with a low-level init system on their server.\nSupervisor is a process manager which provides a singular interface for managing and monitoring a number of long-running programs. In this tutorial, you will install Supervisor on a Linux server and learn how to manage Supervisor configurations for multiple applications.\nPrerequisites A Linux server and either a super user ( root) or any non-root user with sudo privileges. apt repository configured server to install packages 1\\. Installation Begin by updating your package sources and installing Supervisor:\napt update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt install supervisor After installation, the supervisor service will run on its own. You can find out how it’s going:\nsystemctl status supervisor 2 - Adding a Program The best way to use Supervisor is to write a configuration file for each programme it will run.\nAll programmes that run under Supervisor must run in a mode that doesn’t run in the background. This is sometimes called “foreground mode.” If your programme automatically goes back to the shell after running by default, you may need to look in the program’s manual to find the option to turn on this mode. If you don’t, Supervisor won’t be able to tell what the program’s status is.\nTo show how Supervisor works, we’ll make a shell script that does nothing but print out a predictable message every second. This script will run in the background until someone manually stops it. Open up a file in your home directory called idle.sh with nano or your favourite text editor:\nvi ~/idle.sh Add the following contents:\n#!/bin/bash while true do # Echo current date to stdout echo `date` # Echo 'error!' to stderr echo 'error!' \u003e\u00262 sleep 1 done Next, make your script executable:\nchmod +x ~/idle.sh Supervisor programmes’ per-program configuration files are in the /etc/supervisor/conf.d directory. Most of the time, one programme runs per file, and the files end in.conf. We’ll make a configuration file for this script called “/etc/supervisor/conf.d/idle.conf:\nvi /etc/supervisor/conf.d/idle.conf command=/home/ubuntu/idle.sh autostart=true autorestart=true stderr_logfile=/var/log/idle.err.log stdout_logfile=/var/log/idle.out.log Now review this by\ncommand=/home/ubuntu/idle.sh The configuration begins by defining a program with the name idle and the full path to the program:\nautostart=true autorestart=true The autostart option tells Supervisor to start this programme when the system starts up. If you set this to false, the system will need to be started by hand after being shut down.\nautorestart defines how Supervisor should manage the program in the event that it exits:\nOnce our configuration file is made and saved, we can use the supervisorctl command to tell Supervisor about our new programme. First, we tell Supervisor to look in the /etc/supervisor/conf.d directory for any new or changed programme configurations.\nsupervisorctl reread supervisorctl update Any time you make a change to any program configuration file, running the two previous commands will bring the changes into effect.\n3\\. Managing Programs You won’t just want to run programmes; you’ll also want to stop, restart, or check the status of them.

Testing out the Development Server":" How to install Django on Alma Linux\nIn this document, we will learn how to install Django on Alma Linux. Django is a web framework written in Python that lets you make interactive websites and apps. With Django, it’s easy to make Python web apps, and the framework takes care of a lot of the hard work for you.\nIt works quickly and is made to help developers get their apps up and running as soon as possible. Django helps developers avoid common security mistakes like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking.\nThis guide will show you how to put Django on a server running Alma Linux. After you’ve installed it, you’ll make a new project that will be the basis for your website.\nPostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite are the four main databases that Django supports. Other popular SQL and NoSQL databases are supported at different levels by community libraries. We recommend that you choose the same database for production and development, even though Django’s Object-Relational Mapper brings out many of the differences in the database (ORM).\nMethods to install Django There are different ways to install Django, depending on your needs and how you want to set up your development environment. There are pros and cons to each of these, and one might work better for you than the others.\nSome of the different ways are:\nGlobal install from packages: The standard yum package manager in Alma Linux can be used to install Django packages from the official repositories. This is simple, but not very adaptable. It’s also possible that the version in the repositories is behind the official project version.\nIn a virtual environment, you can install with pip: Using tools like venv and virtualenv, you can give each of your projects its own environment. With a virtual environment, you can put Django and other customizations and packages for the project in the project directory. Most of the time, this is the best and most practical way to work with Django.\nTo install the development version with git: If you want to install the latest development version, you can get the code from the Git repository instead of the stable release. This needs to be done in your virtual environment so that you can get the latest fixes and features. But development models aren’t as stable as versions that have been tested more. (Not covered by this document)\nPrerequisites: Any browser installed on your machine\nSuper user or any normal user with SUDO privileges.\nInstallation Steps: 1. Global Install from Packages If you want to use the yum repositories to set up Django, the process is very easy.\nStep 1: First step is to install Epel-release:\nyum install epel-release -y Step 2: Now check the version of Python you installed on your Alma Linux server. You can see if it’s true by:\npython3 –V Step 3: You can now put Django on your computer:\nyum install python3-django Step 4: You can make sure the installation is right by:\ndjango-admin version Django version\nThis means that the software will be installed correctly. You might also find that the version of Django you have is not the latest stable version.\n2. Install Django with pip in a Virtual Environment Django can be installed on your system in a virtual environment in a flexible and easy way. We’ll show you how to install Django in a virtual environment, which will be made with the venv module in the standard Python 3 library. With this tool, you can create a virtual Python environment and install Python packages without affecting the rest of the system. So, you can choose Python packages for each project, even if they conflict with the needs of other projects.\nStep 2.1: First list the local package index:\nyum repolist Step 2.2: Check the version of Python that is installed:\npython3 -V Step 2.3: Now, install pip using the yum repositories:\nyum install python3-pip python3-venv -y Step 2.4: Now, whenever you start a new project, you can set up a virtual environment for it. Start by making a new project directory and moving it to the new one:\nmkdir ~/testProject cd ~/testProject Step 2.5: Next, use the python command in the project directory to set up a virtual environment for your version of Python. We’ll call my env as our virtual environment, but you should call it descriptive:\npython3.8 - venv my_env Step 2.6: This will install standalone versions of Python and pip in your project directory into a separate directory structure. The file hierarchy for where your packages will be installed will be put in a directory with the name you give it.\nPackages can be install into the isolated environment by:\nsource my_env/bin/activate Prompt after executing above command\nStep 2.7: Your prompt should now say that your virtual environment is up and running. It will look like (my env)username@hostnamenewProject$.\nYou can add Django to your new environment with pip. No matter what version of Python you have, you should only call pip when you are in your virtual environment. Also, because you are installing locally, you won’t need sudo:\npip install django Keep in mind that this version may be different.\nStep 2.8: To leave your virtual environment, you must send the deactivate command from anywhere on the system:\ndeactivate 3. Creating a Sample Project with newly installed Django With Django, you can start building your project. We will talk about how to make a project and test it on your development server using a virtual environment.\nStep 3.1: After following the above steps, you jest need to follow the below steps to create a sample project with your newly installed Django\nWith startproject, you can use the django-admin command to build your project. You could call this something else, but we’re going to call our project djangoproject. In the working directory you already have, startproject will create a directory with:\n(myEnv) $ django-admin startproject Step 3.2: Using the manage.py command to migrate the database. Migration takes into account any changes you have made to your database schema in your Django models.\nTo move the database, you can:\n(myEnv) $ python3.8 manage.py migrate Migrate the database of Django project\nLastly, let’s make an administrative user so you can use the Djano admin interface. Using the createsuperuser command, let’s do this:\n(myEnv) # python3.8 manage.py createsuperuser You will be asked to give your user a user name, an email address, and a password.\n4. Changing the ALLOWED HOSTS setting in Django You will need to change one of the directives in the Django settings in order to test your app.\nStep 4.1: Type: to open the settings file.\nvi ~/django-test/djangoproject/settings.py Find the ALLOWED HOSTS directive inside. This sets up a list of addresses or domain names that can be used to connect to the Django instance. If a request comes in with a Host header that is not on this list, an exception will be thrown. Django needs you to set this so that a certain type of security hole doesn’t happen.\nSave the file and close the editor when you are done.\nStep 4.2: Put the IP addresses or domain names that are connected to your Django server in the square brackets. Each item should be written in quotation marks, with a comma between each entry. Add a period to the beginning of the entry to get requests for the whole domain and any subdomains:\nALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_server_ip_or_domain', 'your_second_ip_or_domain', . . .] Step 4.3: Save the file and close the editor when you are done.\n5. Testing out the Development Server Once you have a user, you can start up the Django development server to see what a new Django project looks like. You should only use this to build something. When you are ready to deploy, make sure to carefully follow Django’s deployment instructions.\nStep 5.1: Make sure that the right port is open in your firewall before you try the development server. If you set up your server according to the initial setup guide and are using UFW, you can open port 8000 by typing:\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --allow-port=8000/tcp firewall-cmd --reload Step 5.2: Start the development server:\n(myEnv) # python3.8 manage.py migrate Running Django project after installing Django successfully\nVisit your server’s IP address followed by :8000 in your favourite web browser:\nYou should see something that looks like the below screenshot:\nIn this article, your have learnt how to install Django on Alma Linux","installation-steps#Installation Steps:":"","methods-to-install-django#Methods to install Django":"","prerequisites#Prerequisites:":""},"title":"How to install Django on Alma Linux"},"/docs/linux/how-to-install-django-on-debian-server/":{"data":{"":"","1-global-install-from-packages#1.

If you set up your server according to the initial setup guide and are using UFW, you can open port 8000 by typing:\nufw allow 8000 Step 5.2: Start the development server:\n(myEnv) # python3.8 manage.py migrate Running Django project after installing Django successfully\nVisit your server’s IP address followed by :8000 in your favourite web browser:\nYou should see something that looks like the below screenshot:\nDjango Homepage\nTo access the admin interface, add /admin/ to the end of your URL and it will take you to the admin login page.\nUser login page\nCongratulations!

With Flatpak, users can execute applications independently from the rest of the system in a sandbox.\nFlatpak tries to be as environment- and framework-neutral as possible, making it compatible with a wide variety of desktop environments.\nAdvantages of using Flatpaks on Fedora 1. Updating applications is simple and does not require a system restart.\n2. Fedora silverblue has a simple application installation process.\n3. All officially approved Fedora releases are suitable with Flatpaks.\n4. In other words, users of any distribution can use Flatpaks.\nInstall Flatpak on Fedora 35\n1. Install updates The first thing for any system is to update its repositories in order to make them up to date.\n# dnf update -y 2. Install Flatpak dependencies # dnf install fedmod 3. Install Flatpak on Fedora 35 # dnf install flatpak-module-tools Check the version of installed Flatpak\n# flatpak --version 4. Add user to mock group Mock is a tool for creating RPM packages in a repeatable manner. Fedora’s build system uses it to create a chroot environment for compiling RPM source packages.\nTo add the user into mock group use the following command\n# usermod -a -G mock $USER Restart your system for the changes to take effect.\n5. Install Flatpak runtime environment Since Flatpak is a container on the Fedora platform, we need to allow remote testing on our machine.\nAdd remote testing\n# flatpak remote-add fedora-testing oci+https://registry.fedoraproject.org#testing Enable remote testing\n# flatpak remote-modify --enable fedora-testing Test Flatpak\nYou can test its functionality by running the following comman\n# flatpak install fedora-testing org.fedoraproject.Platform/x86_64/f35 6. Enable Flathub Flatpak’s app repository is called Flathub. Basically, it’s a mirror of Dockerhub, but for docker images. Simply enter this command to install any programme you like.\n# wget https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo The following command, for some reason, can be used independently on both GNOME and KDE Fedora installations. Add the Fathub remote manually with the following command if that fails to work.\n# flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo Install app with Flathub\nLet’s have a look at a real-world application installation using Flathub as an example.

To secure the installation, MySQL comes with a script that will ask whether we want to modify some insecure defaults. Initiate the script by typing. ``` # sudo mysql_secure_installation This script will ask if you want to configure the `VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN`. Answer `Y` for yes, or anything else to continue without enabling. VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN can be used to test passwords and improve security. It checks the strength of password and allows the users to set only those passwords which are secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD plugin? Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No. Next, you’ll be asked to submit and confirm a root password. For the rest of the questions, you should press `Y` and hit the `ENTER` key at each prompt. This will remove some anonymous users and the test database, disable remote root logins, and load these new rules so that MySQL immediately respects the changes we have made. 3. Installing PHP You now have Nginx installed to serve your pages and MySQL installed to store and manage your data. However, you still don’t have anything that can generate dynamic content.

Designed to replace MySQL seamlessly, Debian now only includes MariaDB packages out of the box. The compatible MariaDB replacement versions will be installed in their place if you try to install packages related to the MySQL server.\nThe following three stages make up the abbreviated installation guide:\n_Using apt, bring your package index up to date.\n_Using apt, install the mariadb-server package. Additionally, the package includes associated tools for interacting with MariaDB.\n*To restrict access to the server, run the mysql secure installation security script that is included in the package.\n#sudo apt update #sudo apt install mariadb-server #sudo mysql_secure_installation This guide will show you how to install MariaDB version 10.3 on a Debian 10 server, then check to make sure it is up and running with a secure initial setup.\nPrerequisites\nYou will require one Debian 10 server configured with a firewall and a non-root user with sudo rights in order to finish this tutorial. By following our basic server setup guide, you may set this up.\nStep 1 — Installing MariaDB\nMariaDB version 10.3 is by default available in the APT package repositories for Debian 10. The MySQL/MariaDB packaging team for Debian has designated it as the default MySQL variation.\nUpdate your server’s package index with apt to install it:\n#sudo apt update install the package:\n#sudo apt install mariadb-server These scripts will install MariaDB, but they won’t ask you to modify any configuration settings or set a password. Because MariaDB’s default settings make your installation insecure, you’ll use a script provided by the mariadb-server package to limit server access and delete unused users.\nStep 2 — Configuring MariaDB\nRunning the provided security script is the next step for fresh MariaDB installations. The default settings that are less secure are changed by this script. It will be put to use in order to eliminate unused database users and prevent remote root logins.\nActivate the upcoming security script:\n#sudo mysql_secure_installation This prompts you to adjust MariaDB’s security options. First, enter the database root password. Press ENTER to signify “none” since you haven’t set one up.\nNext, you’re asked to set a database root password. Enter N. In Debian, the MariaDB root account is tied to automated system maintenance, therefore don’t change its authentication methods. By removing access to the administrative user, a package update could disrupt the database system. If socket authentication isn’t acceptable for your use case, we’ll cover setting up a second administrative account for password access.\nFrom there, press Y and then ENTER to accept all defaults. This removes anonymous users and the test database, disables remote root logins, and loads new rules so MariaDB respects your changes.\nStep-3 User Authentication and Privileges Changing\nIn Debian 10.3 systems, the root MariaDB user authenticates using the unix socket plugin rather than a password. This increases security and usability in many circumstances, but it might complicate matters when granting administrative access to an external software (e.g., phpMyAdmin).\nBecause the server uses the root account for log rotation and starting and stopping, don’t modify its authentication information. Changing credentials in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf may work initially, but package updates may overwrite them. Instead of altering root, package maintainers advocate creating a password-protected administrator account.\nTo demonstrate, we’ll create an admin account with the same permissions as root, but password authentication. Open your terminal’s MariaDB prompt:\n#sudo mysql Create a new user now with root access and password-based authentication. To suit your tastes, modify the username and password:\n[consiole]maridb\u003e #GRANT ALL ON . TO ‘admin’@’localhost’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘password’ WITH GRANT OPTION;[/console]\nTo make sure that the privileges are saved and accessible for the current session, flush them:\nmariadb\u003e #FLUSH PRIVILEGES; exit the MariaDB shell:\nmariadb\u003e exit Output Bye Let’s make sure the MariaDB installation is working properly.\nStep 4 — Testing MariaDB\nMariaDB ought should launch automatically after installation from the default repository. Check its status to see if this works:\n#sudo systemctl status mariadb Output ● mariadb.service - MariaDB 10.3.31 database server Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service; enabled; vendor preset: Active: active (running) since Mon 2022-03-14 18:33:32 UTC; 2min 2s ago Docs: man:mysqld(8) https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/systemd/ Main PID: 3229 (mysqld) Status: \"Taking your SQL requests now...\" Tasks: 31 (limit: 4915) Memory: 74.4M CGroup: /system.slice/mariadb.service └─3229 /usr/sbin/mysqld Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: performance_schema Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: Phase 6/7: Checking and u Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: Running 'mysqlcheck' with Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: # Connecting to localhost Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: # Disconnecting from loca Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: Processing databases Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: information_schema Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: performance_schema Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: Phase 7/7: Running 'FLUSH Mar 14 18:33:32 mariadb /etc/mysql/debian-start[3267]: OK Start MariaDB with sudo systemctl start mariadb.\nTry connecting to the database using the mysqladmin client to run administrative commands.

It is designed to replace MySQL seamlessly.\nThe three steps below make up the condensed version of this installation guide:\n_Using apt, bring your package index up to date.\n_Using apt, install the mariadb-server package. Additionally, the package includes associated tools for interacting with MariaDB.\n*Run the included mysql_secure_installation security script to restrict access to the server\n#sudo apt update #sudo apt install mariadb-server #sudo mysql_secure_installation This tutorial will show you how to install MariaDB on a Debian 11 server and ensure that it is up and running with a secure initial configuration.\nPrerequisites\n*You will need a server running Debian 11 to complete this tutorial. This server should have a non-root administrative user and a UFW-enabled firewall. Set this up by following our Debian 11 initial server setup guide.\nStep 1 — Installing MariaDB\nAs of this writing, MariaDB version 10.5.15 is available in Debian 11’s default software repositories. The Debian MySQL/MariaDB packaging team has designated it as the default MySQL variant.\nTo install it, use apt to update your server’s package index:\n#sudo apt update Then proceed to install the package:\n#sudo apt install mariadb-server These commands will install MariaDB but will not prompt you to set a password or change any other settings. Because the default configuration makes your MariaDB installation insecure, you will use a script provided by the mariadb-server package to restrict server access and remove unused accounts.\nStep 2 — Configuring MariaDB\nThe following step for new MariaDB installations is to run the included security script. This script modifies some of the less secure default options for things like remote root logins and sample users.\nRun the security script:\n#sudo mysql_secure_installation This will take you through a series of prompts where you can modify the security settings for your MariaDB installation. The first prompt will request your current database root password. Because you haven’t yet created one, press ENTER to indicate “none.”\nOutput NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE! PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY! In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, you'll need the current password for the root user. If you've just installed MariaDB, and you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank, so you should just press enter here. Enter current password for root (enter for none): You’ll be asked if you want to use unix socket authentication. You can skip this step if you already have a protected root account. Enter n and then press ENTER.\nOutput . . . Setting the root password or using the unix_socket ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB root user without the proper authorisation. You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'. Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] n The next prompt asks if you want to change the root password. Because the root account for MariaDB is closely linked to automated system maintenance in Debian 11, you should not change the configured authentication methods for that account.\nBy doing so, a package update could break the database system by removing access to the administrative account. Enter n followed by ENTER.\nOutput Change the root password? [Y/n] If socket authentication isn’t appropriate for your use case, you’ll learn how to create an additional administrative account for password access later.\nFrom there, you can accept the defaults for all subsequent questions by pressing Y and then ENTER. This will remove some anonymous users and the test database, disable remote root logins, and load these new rules so that MariaDB can immediately apply your changes.\nYou’ve now completed MariaDB’s initial security configuration. The next step is optional, but you should do it if you prefer to use a password to connect to your MariaDB server.\nStep.3 Establishing a New Administrative User Who Will Require a Password for Authentication\nOn Debian systems running MariaDB 10.5, the root MariaDB user authenticates via the unix socket plugin by default. This increases security and usability in many circumstances, but it might complicate matters when granting administrative access to an external software (e.g., phpMyAdmin).\nBecause the server uses the root account for log rotation and starting and stopping, don’t modify its authentication information. Changing credentials in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf may work initially, but package updates may overwrite them. Instead of altering root, package maintainers advocate creating a password-protected administrator account.\nTo do this, we’ll create an admin account with the same permissions as root but password authentication. Terminal MariaDB prompt:\n#sudo mariadb Then, make a new user with root privileges and password access. Change the username and password to reflect your preferences:\nmariadb \u003e #GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION; To ensure that the privileges are saved and available in the current session, flush them:\nmariadb \u003e #FLUSH PRIVILEGES; exit the MariaDB shell:\nmariadb \u003e #exit Now that everything is in place, let’s check out MariaDB.\nStep 4 — Testing MariaDB\nMariaDB will start automatically when installed from the default repositories. Check its status to see if it works.\n#sudo systemctl status mariadb You’ll get output that looks somewhat like this:\nOutput ● mariadb.service - MariaDB 10.5.15 database server Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Fri 2022-03-11 22:01:33 UTC; 14min ago Docs: man:mariadbd(8) https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/systemd/ . . .

The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.\nStep 1 – Adding the MongoDB Repository The CentOS default repositories do not contain the mongodb-org package. MongoDB does, however, keep a separate repository. Add it to our server now.\nCreate a.repo file for yum, the package management utility for CentOS, using the vi editor by following these steps:\n# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org.repo Then add the following context in file:\n[filecode][mongodb-org-3.4]\nname=MongoDB Repository\nbaseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/3.4/x86_64/\ngpgcheck=1\nenabled=1\ngpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.4.asc[/filecode]\nSave the file by escape colon wq\nBefore we continue, we need to make sure that the yum utility contains a MongoDB repository. If it does, then we can carry on. The repolist command will give a list of the repositories that are currently enabled:\n# yum repolist With the MongoDB Repository in place, let’s proceed with the installation.\nStep 2 – Installing MongoDB We can install the mongodb-org package from the third-party repository using the yum utility.\n# yum install mongodb-org -y # systemctl start mongod # systemctl status mongod After performing the start command, the systemctl utility did not produce a result; however, we can verify that the service started by examining the mongod.log file using the tail command and looking at the end of the file:\n# sudo tail /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log The database server, MongoDB, has started properly if the line waiting for a connection appears in the output of the MongoDB Shell:\n# mango The db.help() method returns a set of methods for the db object, which can be used to understand how to interact with MongoDB from the shell.\n# db.help() While exiting the shell, leave the mongod process running in the background:\n# exit Step 3 – Verifying Startup Because a database-driven application can’t work without a database, we’ll make sure that the MongoDB daemon, mongod, starts up with the system.\nCheck its startup status with the systemctl command:\n# systemctl is-enabled mongod; echo $? A result of 0 means that the daemon is running, which is what we want. A one, on the other hand, means that the daemon is disabled and will not start.\nIf a daemon is turned off, use the systemctl command to turn it on:\n# sudo systemctl enable mongod We now have an instance of MongoDB that is running and will start up automatically when the system reboots.\nStep 4 – Importing an Example Dataset (Optional) There is no sample data available in the MongoDB test database like there is in other database servers. Instead of risking the integrity of our production data by testing out new software on it, we’ll import a sample dataset from the “Getting Started with MongoDB” documentation’s “Import Example Dataset” section. To get comfortable with working with MongoDB without risking any important information, we’ll be practicing on a JSON document containing a list of restaurants.\nTo begin, please change to a directory that can be modified:\n# cd /tmp To obtain the JSON file, simply use the curl command and the corresponding link from MongoDB:\n# curl -LO [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/primer-dataset/primer-dataset.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/primer-dataset/primer-dataset.json) The data will be imported into the demo database using the mongoimport command. Using the —db parameter, you can provide the database to use; the —collection flag can define the collection within the database; and the —file flag can specify the file to import from.\n# mongoimport --db test --collection restaurants --file /tmp/primer-dataset.json Following the installation of the sample dataset, we will carry out a query on it.\nRelaunch the MongoDB Shell:\n# mongo By default, the shell will use the test database, which is where we transferred our information.\nTo see a complete listing of the restaurants in the dataset, we can use the find() method to query the restaurants collection. Since there are more than 25,000 items in the collection, you can use the limit() method to restrict the results to a smaller size. By inserting newlines and indents, the pretty() technique also improves readability.\n# db.restaurants.find().limit( 1 ).pretty() You can either keep working with the example data to learn more about MongoDB, or you can remove it entirely with the db.restaurants.drop() command.\n# db.restaurants.drop() Finally, use the exit command to exit the shell:\n# exit "},"title":"How to Install MongoDB on CentOS"},"/docs/linux/how-to-install-mongodb-on-debian/":{"data":{"":"","conclusion#Conclusion":"Hopefully, now you have learned how to install MongoDB on Debian.\nThank You 🙂","creating-administrative-mongodb-user#Creating Administrative MongoDB User":"If you chose to enable the MongoDB authentication, you will be required to generate an administrative user who is authorised to access and control the MongoDB instance.

It enables developers to design scalable backend functionality using JavaScript, a language that many web browser developers are already familiar with.\nIn this post, we will demonstrate three distinct methods for installing Node.js on a CentOS 8 server:\nutilising dnf to install the nodejs package from CentOS’s default AppStream repository utilising nvm, the Node Version Manager, to install and manage different versions of node constructing and installing node from source\nThe majority of users should utilise dnf to install the pre-packaged versions of Node that are pre-installed with their operating system. Use the nvm method if you are a developer or otherwise require the management of many Node installations. Rarely are most users required to build from source.\nTo Install Node.js on CentOS 8 follow the below steps that will help you to increase you knowledge..\nPrerequisites\nYou will require a server running CentOS 8 in order to finish this tutorial. We’ll presume you’re signed in as a non-root, sudo-capable user on this server.","step-1-node-installation-from-the-centos-appstream-repository#Step .1 Node installation from the CentOS AppStream Repository":"Node.js is accessible via the default AppStream software repository on CentOS 8. Multiple versions are available, and you can choose between them by activating the desired module stream. Using the dnf command, list the available streams for the nodejs module.\n#sudo dnf module list nodejs Output Name Stream Profiles Summary nodejs 10 [d] common [d], development, minimal, s2i Javascript runtime nodejs 12 common, development, minimal, s2i There are two streams available: 10 and 12. The [d] indicates that the default stream is version 10. Switch module streams now if you prefer to install Node.js 12:\n#sudo dnf module enable nodejs:12 You will be asked to confirm your choice. The version 12 stream will then be enabled, and we can proceed with the installation. See the official CentOS AppStream documentation for more information on working with module streams.\nUsing dnf, install the nodejs package:\n#sudo dnf install nodejs dnf will ask you to confirm the actions it will take once more. To do so, press y then ENTER, and the software will be installed.\nCheck that the installation was successful by inquiring about the version number of node:\n#node --version Output v12.13.1 If you installed Node.js 10 instead, the answer you get from —version will be different.\nNoteBoth Node.js versions are long-term support releases, which means they have a longer guaranteed window of maintenance. More lifecycle information can be found on the official Node.js releases page.\nThe npm Node Package Manager tool should be installed as a dependency along with the nodejs package. Check to make sure it was installed correctly as well:\n#npm --version Output 6.12.1 At this point, you have successfully used the CentOS software repositories to install Node.js and npm. In the next section, you’ll learn how to do this with the help of the Node Version Manager.","step-3-putting-node-in-place-from-its-source-code#Step .3 Putting Node in place from its source code":"You can also download the source code and compile it yourself to set up Node.js.\nTo do this, use your web browser to go to the official Node.js download page, right-click on the Source Code link, and choose Copy Link Address or a similar option.\nOnce you’re back in your SSH session, make sure you’re in a directory where you can write. We’ll use the home directory of the user who is logged in:\n#cd ~ After that, you should type curl, then paste the link that you copied from the webpage, and after that, you should type | tar xz:\n#curl https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.16.1/node-v12.16.1.tar.gz | tar xz This will download the source using curl, then pipe it directly to the tar utility, which will extract it into the current directory.\nEnter the following code into the newly created source directory:\n#cd node-v* In order to compile the code, we need to get a few packages from the CentOS repositories. Install these now with dnf:\n#sudo dnf install gcc-c++ make python2 You will be asked to confirm that you want to install. To do this, type y and press ENTER. We can now set up and build the software:\n#./configure #make -j4 It will take a long time to put everything together (around 30 minutes on a four-core server). We used the -j4 option to make four compilations happen at the same time. You can leave this option out or change the number to match how many processor cores you have.\nWhen the compilation is done, you can type: to install the software on your system.\n#sudo make install Ask Node to show its version number to see if the installation went well:\n#node --version output v12.16.1 If you see the right version number, that means the installation went well. By default, Node also instals a version of npm that works with it, so that should also be available.\nMust read:- https://utho.com/docs/tutorial/2-methods-for-re-running-last-executed-commands-in-linux/\nYou should now understand How to Install Node.js on CentOS 8…\nThankyou","step2-node-version-manager-installation#Step.2 Node Version Manager installation":"Using nvm, the Node Version Manager, is another flexible method of installing Node.js. Using this piece of software, you can simultaneously install and maintain numerous separate Node.js versions and their corresponding Node packages.\nVisit the project’s GitHub website to learn how to install NVM on a CentOS 8 system. From the README file that appears on the home page, copy the curl command. You can obtain the installation script’s most recent version by doing this.\nIt is always a good idea to audit the script to make sure it isn’t doing anything you don’t agree with before pipelining the command through to bash. The | bash segment at the end of the curl command can be removed to do that:\n#curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh Check to see whether you like the modifications.

By typing any of the release versions you see, you can install a particular version of Node. For instance, you can type: to receive version v13.6.0.\n#nvm install v13.6.0 You can see what versions you have by typing:\n#nvm list Output -\u003e v13.6.0 default -\u003e v13.6.0 node -\u003e stable (-\u003e v13.6.0) (default) stable -\u003e 13.6 (-\u003e v13.6.0) (default) The first line shows the currently active version (-\u003e v13.6.0), followed by some named aliases and the versions to which those aliases point.\nNote If you also have a version of Node installed from the CentOS software repositories, you may see a system -\u003e v12.13.1 (or some other version number) line here. You can always use nvm use system to turn on the system version of Node.\nIn addition, you will notice aliases for the various Node long-term support (LTS) releases:\nOutput lts/* -\u003e lts/erbium (-\u003e N/A) lts/argon -\u003e v4.9.1 (-\u003e N/A) lts/boron -\u003e v6.17.1 (-\u003e N/A) lts/carbon -\u003e v8.17.0 (-\u003e N/A) lts/dubnium -\u003e v10.19.0 (-\u003e N/A) lts/erbium -\u003e v12.16.1 (-\u003e N/A) With these aliases, we can also install a release.

You should typically install npm, the Node.js package manager, as well. Install the npm package using apt to accomplish this:\n#sudo apt install npm This instals Node.js modules and packages.\nYou’ve installed Node.js and npm using apt and Ubuntu’s default repositories. Next, we’ll use an other repository to install Node.js.","step2-apt-installation-of-nodejs-using-a-nodesource-ppa#Step.2 Apt Installation of Node.js Using a NodeSource PPA":"NodeSource maintains a PPA to install different versions of Node.js.

It makes use of and extends the SQL language, and it combines this with a number of features that allow it to safely store and grow even the most complex data demands.\nPostgreSQL was initially developed in 1986 as a part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California, Berkeley. The core platform has seen continuous development for more than 35 years. PostgreSQL’s origins may be traced back to 1986.\n1. Enable the PostgreSQL Package Repository First, get the latest packages. Apt update can do this:\n# apt update Since the PostgreSQL 15 package is not currently accessible in the default package repository, you will need to enable PostgreSQL’s official package repository using the following commands.\n# sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb\\_release -cs)-pgdg main\" \u003e /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list' # wget -qO- https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/pgdg.asc \u0026\u003e/dev/null 2. Install PostgreSQL 15 Database Server and Client In addition, the postgresql-client package is responsible for installing the client tool, whereas the postgresql package will install the default version of the PostgreSQL database server.\nLet’s install the client and server for PostgreSQL using the apt command that is listed below:\n# apt install postgresql postgresql-client -y After that, let’s check to see if the PostgreSQL service is online and functional:\n# systemctl status postgresql Next, using the psql command line programme, check to see what version of PostgreSQL is currently installed:\n# psql --version 3. Change the Password for the PostgreSQL Admin User We don’t need to enter a password in order to connect to the PostgreSQL server because that setting is default. Now, let’s put this into action with the help of the psql utility:\n# sudo -u postgres psql In this example, we will be using the postgres user. During the process of installing PostgreSQL, a user with administrative privileges is automatically established.\nIt is not a good idea to give administrative users access to the database without requiring them to provide a password. Hence, let’s go ahead and change the password for the postgres user:\n# ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'demoPassword'; The user’s password is set to demoPassword by the SQL query above. Please note that because this is a demo environment, we used a very simple password. But it’s not a good idea to do the same thing in a production environment.\nLet’s make sure that the password was set up correctly. So, first, use the q command to end the current session with the server.\n# \\\\q The outcome of the commands above.\nNow, let’s get reconnecting with the database server:\n# psql -h localhost -U postgres Entering the demoPassword string as a password connects us to the database.\n4. Set up PostgreSQL for Remote Access By default, only the localhost can connect to PostgreSQL. We can easily change the configuration, though, so that remote clients can connect.\nPostgreSQL gets its settings from the file postgresql.conf, which is in the directory /etc/postgresql//main/. Here, the word “version” shows which major version of PostgreSQL is being used.\nIn our case, for example, the file’s full path is /etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf.\n# vi /etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf Now, in a text editor, replace the word “localhost” with “*” at the beginning of the line that begins with the listen addresses.\nThis option can be found under the CONNECTIONS AND AUTHORIZATION submenu. The updated file will look like this:\nBy using escape:wq, you can save and close the file. The next step is to open up IPv4 connections from all clients by editing the pg_hba.conf file.

Redis cache is one of the most widely used caching solutions for accelerating WordPress websites. It is open source like WordPress, making it a wonderful option to use alongside WordPress and not only Wordpress but for your application which uses databases. However, if you are unfamiliar with caching in general, it can be difficult to comprehend what Redis is and how Redis cache operates.\nRedis cache is widely used because it supports nearly all main programming languages. In addition, like WordPress, it is open source, which means it is a well-supported system that is a cost-effective method to speed up your website or application.\nDespite the fact that Redis cache is predominantly used as a caching system to speed up WordPress websites, Redis itself is far more potent. Redis can also be used as a database and a message broker, but the focus of this article will be on its caching capabilities.Redis cache excels when used as an object caching utility for WordPress websites. Since WordPress is such a potent and versatile Content Management System, it contains a large number of frequently accessed data objects.\nPrerequisites A super user or any other user with SUDO privileges Updated Debian 10 or Debian 11 system with apt repositories ready to install packages Steps to install redis on Debian Step 1: If you haven’t done so in a while, update your local apt package cache:\napt-get update Step 2: Now, install Redis using apt utility\napt-get install redis-server This will get Redis and all of its components and install them. After that, you need to make one important change to the Redis setup file, which was automatically made during startup.\nStep 3: Change the supervised value to systemd\nvi /etc/redis/redis.conf Find the supervised keyword in the file. With this command, you can tell an init system to take care of Redis as a service. This gives you more control over how it works. By default, the supervised command is set to “no.” Since you are using Debian, which uses the systemd init system, change this to systemd\nchange the init system to systemd of Redis\nAt this point, that is the only change you need to make to the Redis configuration file. Save and close the file when you are done. Then, restart the Redis service to make the changes to the settings file take effect:\nStem 4: Now, restart the redis service\nsystemctl restart redis 2. Test the Redis setup Before making any more changes to Redis’s setup, it’s a good idea to make sure it works as planned, just like you should do with any new software.

Test the Redis setup":" How to install Redis on Ubuntu\nIn this article you will learn How to install Redis cache on Ubuntu.\nRedis cache is one of the most widely used caching solutions for accelerating WordPress websites. It is open source like WordPress, making it a wonderful option to use alongside WordPress and not only Wordpress but for your application which uses databases..\nHowever, if you are unfamiliar with caching in general, it can be difficult to comprehend what Redis is and how Redis cache operates.\nRedis cache is widely used because it supports nearly all main programming languages. In addition, like WordPress, it is open source, which means it is a well-supported system that is a cost-effective method to speed up your website or application.\nDespite the fact that Redis cache is predominantly used as a caching system to speed up WordPress websites, Redis itself is far more potent. Redis can also be used as a database and a message broker, but the focus of this article will be on its caching capabilities.Redis cache excels when used as an object caching utility for WordPress websites. Since WordPress is such a potent and versatile Content Management System, it contains a large number of frequently accessed data objects.\nPrerequisites A super user or any other user with SUDO privileges Updated Ubuntu 22.04 or Ubuntu 20.04 system with apt repositories ready to install packages Steps to install redis on Ubuntu Step 1: If you haven’t done so in a while, update your local apt package cache:\napt-get update Step 2: Now, install Redis using apt utility\napt-get install redis-server This will get Redis and all of its components and install them. After that, you need to make one important change to the Redis setup file, which was automatically made during startup.\nStep 3: Change the supervised value to systemd\nvi /etc/redis/redis.conf Find the supervised keyword in the file. With this command, you can tell an init system to take care of Redis as a service. This gives you more control over how it works. By default, the supervised command is set to “no.” Since you are using Ubuntu, which uses the systemd init system, change this to systemd\nchange the init system to systemd of Redis\nAt this point, that is the only change you need to make to the Redis configuration file. Save and close the file when you are done. Then, restart the Redis service to make the changes to the settings file take effect:\nStem 4: Now, restart the redis service\nsystemctl restart redis 2. Test the Redis setup Before making any more changes to Redis’s setup, it’s a good idea to make sure it works as planned, just like you should do with any new software. In this step, we will talk about a number of ways to make sure Redis is working properly.\nStep 1: First, make sure the Redis service is up and running: use the command-line client to connect to the server:\nredis-cli Step 2: Use the ping command at the next window to see if you can connect.\nping Connectivity to redis server\nStep 3: This result shows that the link to the server is still alive.

It is an open-source programme that has been developed specifically for Linux and operating systems that are based on Linux.\nYou can use the tool to safeguard your system from being attacked by third parties, maintain your privacy, and enhance its overall security. This programme investigates hidden files, potentially malicious strings, and incorrect permissions in binary files.\nRkhunter does a system scan to determine which rootkits are present by comparing the SHA-1 hashes found in local folders with those found in an online database. Because it is developed in Bash, which offers more portability, this programme is compatible with all UNIX-based operating systems.\nInstallation of Rkhunter The first step is to bring the system up quick with the latest data.\n# apt update Now, type this command to install Rkhunter from Ubuntu’s official repository:\n# apt install rkhunter The system moves you to the window for configuring packages.

It was developed for huge supercomputing facilities, the kind of places where a large number of users and application teams share common installs of software on clusters with unusual architectures and make use of libraries that do not have a standard application binary interface (ABI). Because installing a new version of Spack does not disrupt previously established installations, many configurations are able to live on the same computer without causing any problems.\nFirst and foremost, Spack is easy to understand. It provides a straightforward syntax that makes it possible for users to concisely declare version numbers and configuration parameters. Spack is also easy to use for package writers; package files are written in pure Python, and specs enable package authors to maintain a single file for multiple distinct versions of the same product. Spack’s other benefit is that it is efficient.\n1. Install Dependencies # apt update # apt install build-essential -y 2.

A proxy server is a computer system or router that lets users connect to the internet. So, it makes it harder for hackers to get into a private network. It’s a server.\nEvery computer that is connected to the network has an IP (Internet Protocol) address that identifies it as a unique device. In the same way, the proxy server is a network computer with its own IP address. But sometimes we want to get into restricted websites or servers, but we don’t want to show who we are (IP address). When this happens, the proxy server comes into play. The same thing can be done with the proxy server. It has different levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on how it is used, what the company needs, or what its policies are. In this section, we’ll talk about what a proxy server is, its types, benefits, why you need one, and how it works.\nYou can make web requests from a different IP address than your own by using a proxy server. You can also use a proxy server to find out how the web is served in different places or to avoid being watched or having your web traffic slowed down.\nSquid is a well-known, stable, and open-source HTTP proxy. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to install and set up Squid on an Ubuntu 20.04 server so that it can act as an HTTP proxy.\nPrerequisites: Super User( root user) or any normal user with SUDO priviliges. apt-get package installer A text editor, such as vi/ vim or nano Install squid proxy Step 1: First let’s update the package list of apt\n# apt update Step 2: Install the squid daemon\n# apt install squid Installation of squid\nConfiguring the Squid Proxy Server to allow to connect any device By default, Squid doesn’t let any clients outside of this server connect to it. You’ll need to make some changes to its configuration file, which is located at /etc/squid/squid.conf, in order to make that work.\n# vi /etc/squid/squid.conf length of config file\nSquid configuration file may have more than 9000 numbers of lines and also contains large amount of options. But most of them are already commented and therefore not in use.\nTo find the port on which squid works, find the keyword- http_port in configuration file. In vi or vim, you can search the file by pressing forward slash( / ) and then the keyword.\nhttp_port keyword\nNow search for the ‘http_access deny all’ keyword to allow or check which IP pool or Ips are allowed to connect to the squid.\ncheck allowed ip\nNow slightly above the keyword- http_access deny all, you will find another keyword- ‘http_access allow localhost’. This keyword is used only to connect the squid server by localhost.\nkeywork to connect only by localhost\nHere you can specify either allow to all or to any particular ip or the range of ip pool.\nallow a specific ip\nYou can also create the rules just we do in making rules of access control list. You just need to create a rule and place them accordingly.\nRule for ACL\nNow after making all the changes, please do not forget to restart the squid server’s service.\n# systemctl restart squid Congratulations!!!

MySQL is part of the LAMP stack, which comprises Linux, Apache, and PHP.\nMariaDB is the default MySQL variant in Debian 10. If you need functionality only available in Oracle’s MySQL, you can install packages from a MySQL developer repository.\nIn this lesson, you’ll add the MySQL repository, install MySQL, secure the install, and test that MySQL is running and responding to commands.\nPrerequisites\nYou will need one Debian 10 server with a non-root user with sudo privileges and a firewall configured before beginning this tutorial.\n**Step-1 Including the MySQL Software Repository in the compilation **\nMySQL developers provide a.deb package for configuring and installing software repositories. Once the repositories are set up, you can install software using apt.\nInstall GnuPG, an open-source OpenPGP implementation, first.\nUpdate the local package index with upstream modifications.\n#sudo apt update Installing the gnupg package comes next:\n#sudo apt install gnupg APT will install gnupg and its dependencies after you confirm the installation.\nThe MySQL.deb package will then be downloaded with wget and installed with the dpkg command.\nOpen your web browser and navigate to the MySQL download page. Locate the Download button in the lower-right corner and proceed to the next page. This page will ask you to log in or create an Oracle web account. You can skip that and go straight to the No thanks, just start my download link. Copy the link address by right-clicking it (this option may be worded differently, depending on your browser).\nYou will now download the file. On your server, navigate to a writeable directory, such as the temporary /tmp directory used in this example:\n#cd /tmp Then, use the wget programme to download the file, being sure to replace the highlighted area with the location you copied:\n#wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.22-1_all.deb The file should now be in your current directory. List the files you want to confirm:\n#ls The file you just downloaded will be included in the output list of files, as seen in the example below, which is highlighted:\nOutput . . . mysql-apt-config_0.8.22-1_all.deb . . . You are now ready to begin installation. Run the dpkg command to install, uninstall, and inspect.deb software packages. The -i option specifies that you want to install from the specified file:\n#sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config* You’ll be given a configuration screen during the installation where you can choose the version of MySQL you’d like to use and choose to install repositories for additional MySQL-related utilities. The defaults will only add the repository details for the most recent stable version of MySQL. Use the down arrow to get to the Ok menu choice and press ENTER to select this for our purposes.\nThe repository will now be fully added by the package. To make the new software packages available, you must update your apt package cache:\n#sudo apt update You’re ready to install the MySQL server software now that you’ve added the MySQL repositories. If you need to update the configuration of these repositories, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-apt-config, then sudo apt-get update to refresh your package cache.\nStep 2 — Installing MySQL You may now use apt to install the most recent MySQL server package after adding the repository and after your package cache has been recently updated:\n#sudo apt install mysql-server apt will scan all available mysql-server packages and determine that the package provided by MySQL is the most recent and best candidate. It will then calculate package dependencies and request your approval before proceeding with the installation. Enter y followed by ENTER. The software will be downloaded.\nDuring the configuration phase of the installation, you will be prompted to enter a root password. To proceed, enter and confirm a secure password. Following that, you will be prompted to select a default authentication plugin. To understand the options, read the display. If you are unsure, select Use Strong Password Encryption.\nMySQL should now be installed and operational. Check with systemctl:\n#sudo systemctl status mysql Output ● mysql.service - MySQL Community Server Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service; enabled; vendor preset: en Active: active (running) since Thu 2022-02-24 18:59:22 UTC; 23min ago Docs: man:mysqld(8) http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/using-systemd.html Main PID: 3722 (mysqld) Status: \"Server is operational\" Tasks: 38 (limit: 4915) Memory: 371.7M CGroup: /system.slice/mysql.service └─3722 /usr/sbin/mysqld Feb 24 18:59:21 sql-debian systemd[1]: Starting MySQL Community Server... Feb 24 18:59:22 sql-debian systemd[1]: Started MySQL Community Server. MySQL is installed and operating as indicated by the Active: active (running) line. You’ll add a little additional security to the installation in the following step.\nStep 3 — Securing MySQL For some security-related updates on your fresh install, MySQL includes a command. Run it right away:\n#mysql_secure_installation This will ask for your MySQL root password. Enter it. Now answer yes/no questions. Recap:\nFirst, you’re asked about the validate password plugin, which enforces password restrictions for MySQL users. Enable this based on your security needs. Enter y to enable or skip it. If enabled, you’ll be asked to choose a password validation level from 0–2. Press ENTER to continue.\nYou’ll be asked to change the root password. Since you just installed MySQL, you can skip this. Continue without changing the password.\nThe rest are true. You must remove anonymous MySQL users, disable remote root logins, delete the test database, and reload privilege tables to verify the changes take effect. Good concepts. Enter each y.\nAll prompts will end the script. Now MySQL is secure. Next, launch a client that connects to the server and returns data.\nStep 4 – Testing MySQL The MySQL administrative client for the command line is called mysqladmin. It will allow you to connect to the server and output details about the version and status. Mysqladmin is told to log in as the MySQL root user by the -u root, -p informs the client to request a password, and version is the actual command you want to execute:\n#mysqladmin -u root -p version The output will show the MySQL server’s version, uptime, and other status information as in the examples below:\nOutput mysqladmin Ver 8.0.28 for Linux on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL) Copyright (c) 2000, 2022, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

(Instead of PHP, Perl or Python are sometimes used.)\nPrerequisites\nBefore you begin with this guide, you should have root user account privileges set up on your server.\nLog in to the server with (SSH).\nUpdate the server packages using the command yum update -y .\nSTEP 1-Installation of Apache Server\nThe Apache web server is the most popular web server in the world, making hosting websites a great default option.\nWe can easily install Apache with the package manager of CentOS, yum. Use the below command to install the Apache server .\n# sudo yum install httpd When prompted, enter Y to confirm the Apache installation. Once the installation is complete, start your Apache server with this command:\n# sudo systemctl start httpd You can test if your server is running by entering your public IP address or your domain name in your web browser.\nYou can enable Apache to start on boot with:\n# sudo systemctl enable httpd.service Step 2 — Installing MySQL (MariaDB)\nWith your web server up and running, you can install MariaDB. It will organise and provide access to databases where your site can store information.\nTo install the MariaDB software package, run:\n# sudo yum install mariadb-server When the installation is completed, start MariaDB:\n# sudo systemctl start mariadb You can enable MariaDB to start on boot with this command:\n# sudo systemctl enable mariadb.service To improve the security of your database server, it’s recommended that you run a security script that comes pre-installed with MariaDB. This script will remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to your database system.\nStart the interactive script by running:\n# sudo mysql_secure_installation This script will take you through a series of prompts where you can make some changes to your MariaDB setup. The first prompt will ask you to enter the current database root password. This is not to be confused with the system root user. The database root user is an administrative user with full privileges over the database system. Because you just installed MariaDB and haven’t made any configuration changes, this password will be blank. Press ENTER at the prompt\nThe next prompt asks you whether you’d like to set up a database root password. Type N and then press ENTER.\nFrom there, you can press Y, and then ENTER, to accept the defaults for all the subsequent questions. This will remove anonymous users and the test database, disable remote root login, and load these new rules so that the server immediately respects the changes you have made.\nWhen you’re finished, log in to the MariaDB console by entering:\n# sudo mysql -u root -p This connects you to the MariaDB server as the administrative database user root:\nFor increased security, it’s best to have dedicated user accounts with less expansive privileges set up for every database. This is especially important if you plan on having multiple databases hosted on your server.\nTo demonstrate such a setup, create a database named example_database and a user named example_user. You can replace these names with different values.\nRun the following command from your MariaDB console to create a new database:\n# MariaDB [(none)]\u003e CREATE DATABASE example_database; You can create a new user and grant them full privileges on the custom database you’ve just created. The following command defines this user’s password as “password,” but you should replace this value with a secure password:\n# MariaDB [(none)]\u003eGRANT ALL ON example_database.* TO 'example_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION; This command gives the example_user user full privileges over the example_database database, while preventing this user from creating or modifying other databases on your server.\nUse the FLUSH statement to reload and save the privileges you just granted to example_user:\n# MariaDB [(none)]\u003e FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Exit the MariaDB shell:\n# MariaDB [(none)]\u003e exit You can test if the new user has the proper permissions by logging in to the MariaDB console again, but this time using the example_user credentials you created above:\n# mysql -u example_user -p Note the -p flag in this command, which will prompt you for the password you chose when creating the example_user user. After logging in to the MariaDB console, confirm that you have access to the example_database database with this statement:\n# MariaDB [(none)]\u003e SHOW DATABASES; Your example_database should be listed in the output:\nTo exit the MariaDB shell, type:\n# MariaDB [(none)]\u003e exit Your database system is set up and you can move on to installing PHP.\nStep 3 — Installing PHP\n3.1 Add EPEL and REMI Repository\n# sudo yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm # sudo yum -y install https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm 3.2 Install PHP 7.4 on CentOS 7\nWe can now enable PHP 7.4 Remi repository and install PHP 7.4 on CentOS 7.\n# sudo yum -y install yum-utils # sudo yum-config-manager --enable remi-php74 Install PHP 7.4 on CentOS 7.\n# sudo yum update # sudo yum install php php-cli Accept installation prompt.\nUse the next command to install additional packages:\n# sudo yum install php php-cli php-fpm php-mysqlnd php-zip php-devel php-gd php-mcrypt php-mbstring php-curl php-xml php-pear php-bcmath php-json The current PHP version should be 7.4.![]\nThank You 🙂"},"title":"New"},"/docs/linux/how-to-install-the-opengl-library-on-ubuntu-20-04/":{"data":{"":"\nDescription\nIn this article, we are going to study How to Install the OpenGL Library on Ubuntu 20.04 OpenGL is a free, cross-platform API tool for making 2D and 3D graphics that is open source.

Install Tomcat 10, configure users and roles, and navigate the administrative user interface.. Java applications are served via Apache Tomcat, a web server and servlet container. It is an open source implementation of the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Server Pages, and other Jakarta EE platform technologies.\nThis guide will demonstrate how to install Apache Tomcat 10 on Ubuntu server. Install Tomcat 10, configure users and roles, and navigate the administrative user interface.\nPrerequisites One Ubuntu 20.04 server A super user ( root ) or any normal user with SUDO privileges. 1 — Installing Tomcat To start, you’ll need to get the most recent version and set up a separate user with the right permissions. The Java Development Kit will also be put in (JDK).\nFor security, Tomcat should run as a separate user who doesn’t have any special rights. Run the command below to make a user named tomcat:\n# useradd -m -d /opt/tomcat -U -s /bin/false tomcat Option -s is used to set the by default shell /bin/false This will ensure that it’s not possible to log in as tomcat.\nNow install the JDK. To do this first update the package repository.\n# apt update apt install default-jdk Output after installing the default-JDK\nYou can check the java version\n# java -version Output\nopenjdk version “11.0.16” 2022-07-19\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.16+8-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu120.04)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.16+8-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu120.04, mixed mode, sharing)\nTo install Tomcat, you need the latest Core Linux build for Tomcat 10, which you can get from the downloads page. Choose the most recent version of Core Linux that ends in.tar.gz. At the time of writing, version 10.0.20 was the most recent.\nDownload page of Tomcat\nAnd now navigate to the /tmp directory:\n# cd /tmp Download the tomcat version using wget and then extract the new downloaded file\n# wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.0.23/bin/apache-tomcat-10.0.23.tar.gz Now create a new directory in /opt directory with name tomcat and then extract the tomcat files here.\n# tar xzvf apache-tomcat-10*tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat --strip-components=1 Since you have already made a user, you can now give tomcat ownership of the extracted installation by running:\n# chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat/ chmod -R u+x /opt/tomcat/bin 2 — Configuring Admin Users You will set up privileged users in Tomcat’s configuration so that they can see the Manager and Host Manager pages. You’ll need to get rid of the IP address restrictions, which stop any IP address from the outside from getting to those pages.\nThe file /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml is where Tomcat users are set up. Use the following command to open the file so it can be changed and append the below content.\n# vi /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml \u003crole rolename=\"manager-gui\" /\u003e \u003cuser username=\"manager\" password=\"manager_password\" roles=\"manager-gui\" /\u003e \u003crole rolename=\"admin-gui\" /\u003e \u003cuser username=\"admin\" password=\"admin_password\" roles=\"manager-gui,admin-gui\" /\u003e Replace the passwords that are underlined with your own. Save and close the file when you’re done.\nHere, you set up two user roles, manager-gui and admin-gui, that give each user access to the Manager and Host Manager pages. You also set up roles for two users named manager and admin.\nHere, you set up two user roles, manager-gui and admin-gui, that give each user access to the Manager and Host Manager pages. You also set up roles for two users named manager and admin.\nTomcat is set up so that access to the admin pages is limited unless the connection comes from the server itself. You will need to change the config files for those pages so that the users you just made can get to them.\nTo remove the restriction from the Manager page, you need to edit its config file Comment out the _**Valve**_ definition, as shown::\n# /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml \u003cContext antiResourceLocking=\"false\" privileged=\"true\" \u003e \u003cCookieProcessor className=\"org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Rfc6265CookieProcessor\" sameSiteCookies=\"strict\" /\u003e \u003c!-- \u003cValve className=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve\" allow=\"127\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1\" /\u003e --\u003e \u003cManager sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter=\"java\\.lang\\.(?:Boolean|Integer|Long|Number|String)|org\\.apache\\.catalina\\.filters\\.CsrfPreventionFilter\\$LruCache(?:\\$1)?|java\\.util\\.(?:Linked)?HashMap\"/\u003e \u003c/Context\u003e And now repeat for Host Manager:\n# vi /opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml Now that you’ve set up two users, manager and admin, you can use them to get into parts of the management interface that are normally locked. You will now make a service for Tomcat in systemd.\n3 — Creating a systemd service You will now make a systemd service that will keep Tomcat running in the background. In case of an error or failure, the systemd service will also automatically restart Tomcat.\nTomcat is a Java application, so it needs the Java runtime, which you installed in step 1 with the JDK. You need to know where Java is before you can run the service. Using the following command, you can find out:\n# update-java-alternatives -l Output:\njava-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64 1111 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64\nIn the last column, you can see the path to where Java is. In a moment, you’ll need the path to define the service.\nUnder /etc/systemd/system, you will save the tomcat service in a file called tomcat.service. Make the file editable by doing.\n# vi /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service [Unit]\nDescription=Apache Tomcat Web Application Container\nAfter=network.target\n[Service]\nType=forking\nUser=tomcat\nGroup=tomcat\nEnvironment=“JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64”\nEnvironment=“JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom -Djava.awt.headless=true”\nEnvironment=“CATALINA_BASE=/opt/tomcat”\nEnvironment=“CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat”\nEnvironment=“CATALINA_PID=/opt/tomcat/temp/tomcat.pid”\nEnvironment=“CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -server -XX:+UseParallelGC”\nExecStart=/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh\nExecStop=/opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nChange the highlighted JAVA HOME value if it is different from the one you wrote down earlier.\nHere, you set up a service that will run Tomcat by running the scripts it provides for starting up and shutting down. You also set a few environment variables to set its home directory (which is still /opt/tomcat) and limit the amount of memory the Java VM can use (in CATALINA OPTS). If the Tomcat service fails, it will automatically start up again.\nSave and close the file when you’re done.\nReload the systemd daemon so that it knows about the new service:\n# systemctl daemon-reload You can then start and enable the Tomcat service by typing:\n# systemctl start tomcat systemctl enable tomcat "},"title":"How to install Tomcat 10 on Ubuntu server"},"/docs/linux/how-to-install-tree-command-on-ubuntu-20-04/":{"data":{"":"Description\nIn this article, we will acquire new knowledge how to Install tree command on Ubuntu 20.04\nTree is a free and open-source command-line programme for recursively listing directory contents in a depth-indented format.

Complete the installation of Wordpress":"\nWordPress is one of the most popular content management systems (CMS) on the internet right now. It lets users set up flexible blogs and websites using a MySQL backend and PHP processing. At a very high rate, WordPress is used by both new and experienced engineers. It is a great choice for quickly getting a website up and running. After setting up WordPress for the first time, almost all website management can be done through its graphical interface. This and other features make WordPress a great choice for websites that are meant to grow.\nLEMP stack is a set of free software that helps web servers start up and run. The letters stand for the words Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP. Arch Linux is already running on the server, so that part is taken care of.\nPrerequisites Super user or any normal user with SUDO privileges. The yum repository configured to install the services. Already LEMP installed services. Please follow this link to install LEMP on CentOS server. 1. Setup the MySQL database for wordpress Information for the website and its users is managed by WordPress using a relational database. This feature may be provided by MariaDB, a derivative of MySQL, which is already installed. However, we must create a database and a user for WordPress to utilise.\n# mysql -u root -p \u003e CREATE DATABASE wordpressdb;\n\u003e CREATE USER wordpressuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY ‘password’;\n\u003e GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpressdb.* TO wordpressuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY ‘password’;\nHere, in above MySQL commands, we have created a new database named as wordpressdb, a user named as wordpressuser which will be identified by the password you will provide while executing the command. Please note that all these keywords are just couple of variables, therefore you can choose them as you please.\nIn last command we have granted the rights to the user ‘wordpressuser’ on ‘wordpressdb’ database, which is identified by password you will provide later in the same command.\nNow save the changes and exit from mysql\n\u003e FLUST PRIVILEGES\n\u003e EXIT\n2. Download and install the Wordpress One PHP module has to be installed before we download WordPress in order for it to function correctly. WordPress won’t be able to resize photos to make thumbnails without this module. Using yum, we can get the package straight from the CentOS default repositories:\n# yum install php-gd Now we need to restart nginx service so that it recognizes the new module:\n# systemctl restart nginx Now download the latest version of the wordpress by wget command and extract the newly downloaded wordpress by tar command.\n# wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz tar -zxvf latest.tar.gz After extracting the latest.tar.gz file, you must see a new directory named as wordpress. Move the content of this directory to your website directory or you can move the content to the default page directory on your server.\n# mv wordpress/* /usr/share/nginx/html/ Please note that, in some case, nginx uses the same root directory of your website same as apache/ httpd which /var/www/html. You can ensure this by looking at the keyword ‘root’ in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.\n3. Configure the Wordpress. Later, a web interface will be used to finish the majority of WordPress settings. To make sure that WordPress can connect to the MySQL database that we set up for it, we must do several tasks from the command line.\nWordPress’s primary configuration file is known as wp-config.php. The default installation comes with an example configuration file that mostly matches the values we need. To enable WordPress to identify and use the file, all we need to do is copy it to the place designated by default for configuration files:\n# cd /usr/share/nginx/html cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php The parameters that store the data from our database are the only parts of this file that need to be changed. The DB NAME, DB USER, and DB PASSWORD variables must be changed in the MySQL settings section for WordPress to successfully connect and authenticate to the database that we built.\nWith the data from the database you established, fill in the values of these parameters. It should seem as follows:\nChanges must be made in wp-config.php file\n4.

It lets users set up flexible blogs and websites using a MySQL backend and PHP processing. At a very high rate, WordPress is used by both new and experienced engineers. It is a great choice for quickly getting a website up and running. After setting up WordPress for the first time, almost all website management can be done through its graphical interface. This and other features make WordPress a great choice for websites that are meant to grow. In this article I mentioned 4 Easy-to-follow steps for installing WordPress with LEMP on Ubuntu…\nLEMP stack is a set of free software that helps web servers start up and run. The letters stand for the words Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP. Arch Linux is already running on the server, so that part is taken care of.\nPrerequisites Super user or any normal user with SUDO privileges. apt repository configured to install the services. Already LEMP installed services. Please follow this link to install LEMP on Ubuntu 1 — Configure MySQL User for WordPress WordPress uses MySQL to manage and store information about the site and its users. Even though MySQL is already set up, let’s make a database and a user for WordPress to use.\nIf MySQL is set up to use the auth socket authentication plugin, which is the default, you can log in to the MySQL administrative account using below command.\n# mysql -u root -p \u003e CREATE DATABASE wordpressdb DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci; \u003e CREATE USER 'wordpressuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; \u003e GRANT ALL ON wordpressdb.* TO 'wordpressuser'@'localhost'; First, we’ve made a separate database that can be run by WordPress. You can call this whatever you want, but to keep things simple, we’ll use “WordPressdb” in this guide. Next, we have created a new MySQL user account that will only be used to work with our new database. From a management and security point of view, it’s a good idea to make databases and accounts that only serve one purpose. We will call ourselves wordpressuser. Please ensure that you have used an alphanumeric password for this user. Next, grant access wordpress user to the database you created. Now you can exit from mysql.\n\u003e exit 2 — Install the Additional PHP Extensions. When setting up the LEMP stack, PHP and MySQL could only talk to each other with a very small number of extensions. Many of WordPress’s plugins use extra PHP extensions, and this tutorial will teach you how to use a few more.\nLet’s use WordPress to download and install some of the most popular PHP extensions by typing:\n# apt update apt install php-curl php-gd php-intl php-mbstring php-soap php-xml php-xmlrpc php-zip Now after successfully installing the php extension, just restart php-fpm services.\n# systemctl restart php7.4-fpm 3 — Configure Nginx First of all, We need to put index.php as the first value of our index directive so that when a directory is requested, files named index.php are served if they are available.\n# vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default Make the index.php as first option\nNow, let’s check our configuration for syntax errors by typing:\n# nginx -t Now restart the nginx service.\n# systemctl restart nginx 4- Download and configure the Wordpress Now that your server software is set up, let’s get WordPress downloaded and set up. For security reasons, you should always get the latest version of WordPress directly from the project’s website.\n# wget wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip If you have no binary of wget( wget command not found ), then you can install by using\napt install wget -y And now extract the newly downloaded file by using tar command, most probably, it should be available on your server. Therefore to extract the file, use the below command. unzip latest \u003e If you have no binary of unzip( unzip command not found ), then you can install by using \u003e \u003e ``` # apt install unzip -y output after unziping the latest downloaded wordpress\nlatest created wordpress directory\nAfter extracting the file, move this file’s content to /var/www/html directory\n# mv wordpress/* /var/www/html/ Next, give the webserver ownership of the WordPress files by giving the website directory the right permissions.\n# chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/ chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/ Now, go to the /var/www/html/ directory and copy wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php. Also, make sure to get rid of the nginx index page that comes by default.\n# cd /var/www/html cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php Then, update the highlighted details with your database info in the MySQL settings section\n# vi wp-config.php updating wp-config.php\nNow, restart the nginx and mariadb services using the commands below:\n# systemctl restart nginx mariadb Now go to you browser and enter your serverip\nhttp://server-ip Select the language in this page\nWith this article, I hope you now have a better understanding of how to install WordPress with LEMP on Ubuntu…","prerequisites#Prerequisites":"","unzip-latest#unzip latest":""},"title":"How to Install WordPress with LEMP on Ubuntu"},"/docs/linux/how-to-install-xrdp-server-on-ubuntu-22-04/":{"data":{"":" How to Install Xrdp Server on Ubuntu 22.04\nIn this tutorial, we will learn how to install Xrdp server on Ubuntu 22.04 and configure it.

When they’re on the same partition as the rest of the operating system, this can cause I/O contention.\nRAID, network block storage, and other devices can provide redundancy and scalability, among other benefits. This tutorial will walk you through relocating PostgreSQL’s data directory, whether you’re looking to add more space, optimise performance, or take advantage of other storage features.\nPrerequisites\nYou will need the following items to finish this guide:\nA non-root user with sudo privileges on an Ubuntu 22.04 server. More information on creating a user with these privileges can be found in our Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 22.04 guide.\nPostgreSQL is already installed on your server. If you haven’t already done so, the guide How to Install and Use PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 22.04 can help.\nThroughout this tutorial, the data will be moved to a block storage device mounted at /mnt/volume nyc1 01. Before continuing with this tutorial, if you’re using Block Storage on DigitalOcean, read our documentation on How to Create and Set Up Volumes for Use with Droplets for help mounting your volume.\nRegardless of the underlying storage, the steps below can assist you in moving the data directory to a new location.\nStep 1- Transferring the PostgreSQL Data Directory to a New Location\nBefore we begin moving PostgreSQL’s data directory, let’s check the current location with an interactive PostgreSQL session. psql is the command used to enter the interactive monitor, and -u postgres instructs sudo to run psql as the system’s postgres user:\n#sudo -u postgres psql To display the current data directory, open the PostgreSQL prompt and type the following command:\npostgres=#SHOW data_directory; Output data_directory ----------------------------- /var/lib/postgresql/14/main (1 row) This output confirms that PostgreSQL is configured to use the default data directory, /var/lib/postgresql/14/main, so that’s the directory you need to move. Once you’ve confirmed the directory on your system, use the q meta-command to exit the psql prompt:\npostgres=#q Stop PostgreSQL before making changes to the data directory to ensure the integrity of the data:\n#sudo systemctl stop postgresql The output of all service management commands is not displayed by systemctl. Use the following command to confirm that you have successfully stopped the service:\n#sudo systemctl status postgresql The output should indicate that PostgreSQL is inactive (dead), indicating that it has been terminated:\nOutput ○ postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; vendor\u003e Active: inactive (dead) since Thu 2022-06-30 18:46:35 UTC; 27s ago Process: 4588 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) Main PID: 4588 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) CPU: 1ms Now that the PostgreSQL server is no longer running, use rsync to move the existing database directory to the new location. The -a flag preserves permissions and other directory properties, while -v produces verbose output to assist you in following the progress. You’ll run rsync from the postgresql directory to replicate the original directory structure in the new location. You can avoid permissions issues for future upgrades by creating that postgresql directory within the mount-point directory and retaining ownership by the PostgreSQL user.\nNote: Be sure there is no trailing slash on the directory, which may be added if you use TAB completion. If you do include a trailing slash, rsync will dump the contents of the directory into the mount point instead of copying over the directory itself.\nFollowing the project convention won’t harm, especially if PostgreSQL needs to run different versions in the future. The version directory, 14, isn’t technically necessary since you’ve specified the location explicitly in the postgresql.conf file:\n#sudo rsync -av /var/lib/postgresql /mnt/volume_nyc1_01 Once the copy is finished, give the current folder a.bak extension and leave it there until you’re sure the transfer worked. Having directories with similar names in both the new and old locations will help to prevent confusion:\n#sudo mv /var/lib/postgresql/14/main /var/lib/postgresql/14/main.bak You may now prepare PostgreSQL to access the data directory in its new location by configuring it to use the new path.\n**Step 2 -Using the New Data Location as the Target\n**\nThe default setting for the data directory configuration directive in the /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf file is /var/lib/postgresql/main. This file should be modified to reflect the new data directory:\n#sudo nano /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf . . . data_directory = '/mnt/volume_nyc1_01/postgresql/14/main' . . . By hitting CTRL + X, Y, then ENTER, you can save and close the document. To set up PostgreSQL to use the new data directory location, all you have to do is this. The PostgreSQL service must now be restarted, and it must be verified that it is pointing to the appropriate data directory.\nStep 3 — Restarting PostgreSQL\nStart the PostgreSQL server using systemctl after updating the data-directory directive in the postgresql.conf file:\n#sudo systemctl start postgresql Check the status of the PostgreSQL server once again using systemctl to ensure that it began successfully:\n#sudo systemctl status postgresql If the service started up right, the Active line of the command’s output will say “active (exited)”\nOutput ● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; vendor\u003e Active: active (exited) since Thu 2022-06-30 18:50:18 UTC; 3s ago Process: 4852 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) Main PID: 4852 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) CPU: 1ms Lastly, enter the PostgreSQL command prompt to confirm that the new data directory is truly active:\n#sudo -u postgres psql Again, make sure the value for the data directory is correct:\npostgres=#SHOW data_directory; Output data_directory ---------------------------------------- /mnt/volume_nyc1_01/postgresql/14/main (1 row) This demonstrates that PostgreSQL is utilising the new location for the data directory. After that, take a moment to make sure you can access your database and interact with the data inside. You can delete the backup data directory once you’ve ensured the accuracy of any current data:\n#sudo rm -Rf /var/lib/postgresql/14/main.bak With that, you’ve successfully changed the location of your PostgreSQL data directory."},"title":"How To Move a PostgreSQL Data Directory to a New Location on Ubuntu 22.04"},"/docs/linux/how-to-partition-and-format-storage-devices-in-linux/":{"data":{"":"\nIntroduction\nLinux disc preparation is simple.

If you have access to the server and a user account with sudo rights, you can still acquire access and reset the root password for your MySQL or MariaDB database.\nnote:\nAs long as you connect from the system’s root account, the default MySQL or MariaDB configuration on fresh Ubuntu 18.04 installations typically lets you access the database (with full administrator capabilities) without requiring a password. It might not be essential to reset the password in this case. Try using the sudo mysql command to access the database before changing the database root password. Only if the default setting for authentication was adjusted, and this results in an access denied issue, follow the steps in this tutorial.\nThis guide shows how to reset MySQL and MariaDB’s root passwords on Ubuntu 18.04. Changing the root password depends on whether MySQL or MariaDB is installed and the distribution’s default systemd settings or third-party packages. These instructions may work with different system or database server versions, but they’ve been tested with Ubuntu 18.04 and distribution-supplied packages.\nPrerequisites\nYou’ll need the following to recover your MySQL or MariaDB root password:\nUsing a sudo user or another method of gaining access to the server with root capabilities, you can connect to the Ubuntu 18.04 server that is running MySQL or MariaDB. Create a test server with an ordinary, non-root user who has sudo capabilities using the initial server setup lesson if you want to test out the recovery techniques in this guide without having them impact your production server. Install MySQL after that the best way to set up MySQL on Ubuntu 18.04.","step-1--identifying-the-database-version-and-stopping-the-server#Step 1 — Identifying the Database Version and Stopping the Server":"MySQL or MariaDB, a well-liked drop-in replacement that is 100% compatible with MySQL, are both supported by Ubuntu 18.04. Depending on which of these you have installed, you’ll need to use various commands to recover the root password. To find out which database server you’re running, follow the instructions in this section.\nThe command below will verify your version:\n#mysql --version The result will display “MariaDB” followed by the version number if MariaDB is being used:\nMariaDB output mysql Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.1.47-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 5.2 If you are using MySQL, you will see output similar to this:\nMySQL output mysql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.32, for Linux (x86_64) using EditLine wrapper Note the database you are using because it may affect the commands you should use in the remaining sections of this guide.\nYou must terminate the database server in order to modify the root password. You can use the next command to do so if you are using MariaDB:\n#sudo systemctl stop mariadb To turn off the database server for MySQL, use the following command:\n#sudo systemctl stop mysql You can reset the root password by restarting the database in safe mode after the database has been terminated.","step-3--changing-the-root-password#Step 3 — Changing the Root Password":"The grant tables are not loaded, and networking support is not enabled, thus the database server is now operating in a restricted state. This enables password-free access to the server but prevents you from running commands that change data. Now that you have access to the server, you must load the grant tables in order to reset the root password.\nGive the FLUSH PRIVILEGES command to the database server to instruct it to reload the grant tables:\nmysql\u003e #FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Now you can modify the root password. Whether you’re using MariaDB or MySQL will affect the approach you use.\nPassword-changing MariaDB\nExecute the following command to change the root account’s password if you’re using MariaDB, making sure to replace new password with a secure new one that you’ll remember:\nmariadb\u003e #UPDATE mysql.user SET password = PASSWORD('new_password') WHERE user = 'root'; This output will appear to show that the password has changed:\nOutput Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) Execute the following two commands to ensure that MariaDB will use its default authentication mechanism for the new password you supplied to the root account. MariaDB permits the use of custom authentication techniques.\nmariadb\u003e #UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string = '' WHERE user = 'root'; mariadb\u003e #UPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = '' WHERE user = 'root'; Whenever you run a statement, you’ll see the following results:\nOutput Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec) The password has now been updated. In order to restart the database server in regular mode, type quit to close the MariaDB console and move on to Step 4.\nChanging the MySQL Password\nExecute the following command for MySQL to update the root user’s password, substituting new password with a reliable password you can remember:\nmysql\u003e #UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string = PASSWORD('new_password') WHERE user = 'root'; The following output will show that the password change was successful:\nOutput Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) Execute the following command to instruct MySQL to utilise its default authentication mechanism in order to authenticate the root user with the new password:\nmysql\u003e #UPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = 'mysql_native_password' WHERE user = 'root'; You should see output that is comparable to the earlier command:\nOutput Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) The password has been updated.

Again, the approach you choose will depend on whether you utilised MySQL or MariaDB.\nUnset the MYSQLD OPTS environment variable for MariaDB that you previously set:\n#sudo systemctl unset-environment MYSQLD_OPTS restart the service using systemctl:\n#sudo systemctl restart mariadb Remove MySQL’s modified systemd configuration:\n#sudo systemctl revert mysql You can expect to see results along these lines:\nOutput Removed /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service.d/override.conf. Removed /etc/systemd/system/mysql.service.d. To effect the changes, reload the systemd configuration after that:\n#sudo systemctl daemon-reload restart the service:\n#sudo systemctl restart mysql Now that the database has been restarted, everything is as it should be. By using a password to log in as the root user, you may verify that the new password is functional.\n#mysql -u root -p A password prompt will appear. You will successfully access the database prompt after entering your new password.","step2-database-server-restarting-without-permission-checks#Step.2 Database Server Restarting Without Permission Checks":"Running MySQL and MariaDB without permission checks gives root access without a password. Stop the database from loading grant tables, which store user privileges. You may want to disable networking to prevent other clients from connecting to the temporarily vulnerable server.\nStarting the server without loading the grant tables varies every database server.\nConfiguring MariaDB to Start Without Grant Tables\nWe’ll utilise the systemd unit file to define additional options for the MariaDB server daemon so that it can be started without the grant tables.\nRun the command below to set the MYSQLD OPTS environment variable, which MariaDB uses when it starts up. When starting MariaDB, the —skip-grant-tables and —skip-networking options instruct it to do so without loading the grant tables or networking features:\n#sudo systemctl set-environment MYSQLD_OPTS=\"--skip-grant-tables --skip-networking\" start the MariaDB server:\n#sudo systemctl start mariadb Although this command doesn’t output anything, it will restart the database server using the updated environment variable settings.\nWith sudo systemctl status mariadb, you may confirm that it began.\nNow you shouldn’t need to enter a password to access to the database as the MariaDB root user:\n#sudo mysql -u root MariaDB prompt Type 'help;' or 'h' for help. Type 'c' to clear the current input statement. MariaDB [(none)]\u003e You can modify the root password as indicated in Step 3 now that you have access to the database server.\nSetting Up MySQL to Launch Without Grant Tables\nYou must modify the systemd settings of MySQL to allow additional command-line parameters to be passed to the server during starting if you want to start the server without its grant tables.\nRun the following command to accomplish this:\n#sudo systemctl edit mysql This command opens MySQL’s service overrides in the VI editor. These modify MySQL service defaults. Add the following to this empty file:\n[Service] ExecStart= ExecStart=/usr/sbin/mysqld --daemonize --pid-file=/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking The first ExecStart statement removes the default setting, while the second one gives systemd a new startup command with parameters to stop loading networking and grant tables.\nCTRL-x will close the file, Y will save your changes, and ENTER will confirm the file name.\nTo apply these modifications, reload the systemd configuration:\n#sudo systemctl daemon-reload start the MySQL server:\n#sudo systemctl start mysql The database server will launch even though the programme doesn’t produce any output. The grant tables and networking will not be enabled.\nAs the root user, connect to the database:\n#sudo mysql -u root see a database shell prompt:\nMySQL prompt Type 'help;' or 'h' for help. Type 'c' to clear the current input statement. mysql\u003e You can modify the root password now that you have access to the server."},"title":"How To Reset Your MySQL or MariaDB Root Password on Ubuntu 18.04"},"/docs/linux/how-to-run-application-in-background/":{"data":{"":" How to run application in background\nIn this tutorial, we will learn how to run any application in background using Screen package on linux.\nWe occasionally encountered a scenario where we ran a protracted process to remove the computer and our connection abruptly dropped.

It is promoted as having a sandbox environment, in which users are able to operate application software while remaining completely separate from the rest of the system.\nIn order for applications that use Flatpak to gain access to resources such as Bluetooth, sound (using PulseAudio), the network, and files, the appropriate permissions must be granted. These rights are established by the person who is in charge of maintaining the Flatpak package, but users on their own systems have the ability to add or delete them.\nAnother important benefit of using Flatpak is that it enables application developers to directly offer updates to end users, bypassing distributions in the process. This eliminates the need for the developers to package and test the programme in a manner specific to each distribution.\n1. Keep the server updated # apt upgrade -y 2.

It is made by the people who created MySQL in the first place, so you know it will always be open source. It is included in the majority of cloud providers and comes pre-configured in the majority of Linux versions.\nIt is founded on the values of performance, openness, and stability, and the MariaDB Foundation promises that contributions will be accepted based on the strength of their technical content.

For instance, we have a user account that is called postgres, which is the default name for the PostgreSQL superuser system account. We want every user in the group called postgres to be able to switch to the postgres account using the su command without having to enter a password.\nOnly the root user has the ability to switch to another user account without having to input their password when doing so. Any other user who attempts to switch user accounts will be prompted to enter the password of the user account they are switching to (or, if they are using the sudo command, they will be prompted to enter their own password). If the user does not provide the correct password, they will receive a “authentication failed” error message, which is displayed in the following screenshot.\nTo resolve the problem described above, you can select either of the two options that are offered below. 1.PAM Authentication Module PAM, which stands for pluggable authentication modules, is the foundation of user authentication on contemporary Linux operating systems. We may change the default PAM settings for the su command by editing the /etc/pam.d/su file. This will allow users who belong to a certain group to switch to another user account without needing to provide a password.\n# vim /etc/pam.d/su As shown in the screenshot, add the following configurations after “auth adequate pam rootok.so.”\nauth [success=ignore default=1] pam_succeed_if.so user = postgres auth sufficient pam_succeed_if.so use_uid user ingroup postgres The first line in the preceding setup checks if the target user is postgres; if so, the service checks the current user; otherwise, the default=1 line is bypassed and the standard authentication processes are performed. auth [success=ignore default=1] pam_succeed_if.so user = postgres The line that follows checks to see if the current user is a member of the postgres group; if so, the authentication process is considered successful and returns adequate as a consequence. Otherwise, the standard authentication procedures are followed. auth sufficient pam_succeed_if.so use_uid user ingroup postgres Make sure the file is saved, and then close it. Next, use the usermod command to add the user (like cloud) that you want to be able to su to the account postgres without a password.\nIf you now try to log in to the postgres account using the user cloud, you shouldn’t be asked for a password because it is displayed in the following screenshot that you are already logged in.\n# su - postgres 2.Use of the Sudoers File By adding a few modifications to the sudoers file, you will be able to su to another account without being required to enter a password. To be able to execute the sudo command in this scenario, the user (for example, aaronk) who will switch to another user account (for example, postgres) needs to be included in the sudoers file or in the sudo group.\n# sudo visudo Then, as seen in the screenshot, add the following configuration below the line “%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL.”\nSave and exit the file:\nNow try to log in to the postgres account using the cloud user; the shell should not request you to enter a password at this point.\n# sudo su - postgres That’s all I have to say for now!

Sending out packets and evaluating the responses received from those packets is how Nmap finds hosts and services on a computer network.\nNmap is a tool that may be used to investigate computer networks and offers a variety of functions, such as host discovery and the detection of services and operating systems. Scripts can be used to extend the capabilities of these features so that they can perform more sophisticated vulnerability detection, service discovery, and other detections. During a scan, Nmap is able to adjust itself to different network conditions, such as latency and congestion.\nIf you read the article that has been provided for you here, you will gain more knowledge about the topics that have been discussed. How to Determine the Specifics of the Existing Issues Employing the Nmap Tool when Running on CentOS It is highly recommended that nmap be used whenever there is a requirement to determine whether or not a server is online and able to take connections. This is because nmap is an excellent tool. This decision needs to be made anytime there is a need for it. The nmap tool should be used whenever there is a need to discover whether or not a server is online and able to accept connections. This can be done when there is a need to determine whether or not a server is online. This approach to diagnosing issues with port connectivity involves use of the nmap software, which can be obtained by downloading it from the following location: Nmap is a powerful port scanning application that, once it has scanned the ports on a server, gives you information on the state of those ports as well as the server that they are located on.\nnmap your server’s IP address from another machine.

It is one of the effective instruments for measuring the maximum bandwidth that can be supported by IP networks (supports IPv4 and IPv6).\nYou will need to improve both the throughput and the latency of your network’s receiving and sending capabilities in order to achieve maximum, or at least improved, network performance. This can be accomplished by increasing the throughput of your network’s receiving capabilities. However, before you can begin the real tuning process, you need to run several tests to collect statistics on the overall performance of the network. These statistics will serve as a roadmap for the tuning procedure.\nIts results include the time interval in seconds, the amount of data transferred, the bandwidth (transfer rate), and loss, in addition to other helpful network performance indicators. This is the primary purpose of the tool, which is to assist in adjusting TCP connections across a certain path, and it is on this topic that we will concentrate our attention in this article.","requirements#Requirements:":"Two networked PCs with the iperf3 application installed.\n# apt install iperf3 -y (Debian/Ubuntu) # yum install iperf3 -y (RHEL/CentOS) # dnf install iperf3 -y (Fedora 22+) In order to assess the throughput of a network between two computers, iperf makes use of the concepts of a “client” and a “host.”\nHost: On the host system, the iperf application is told to wait for a connection from a client:\n# iperf3 -s Here,\n-s Allows you to listen in the server role\nClient: Establish a connection to the first on your client.

The value in Retr should be as low as possible. The best value would be 0, which means that no matter how many TCP packets have been sent, not a single one needs to be sent again.\nOne of the things that determines how many bytes can be sent out at any given time is the congestion window (CWND). The sender controls the congestion window, which keeps the link between the sender and the receiver from getting too busy with too much traffic."},"title":"How to Use Iperf to Test Network Performance"},"/docs/linux/how-to-use-iptables-firewall-in-linux/":{"data":{"":" How to use IPTABLES firewall in Linux","deleting-rules-by-chain-and-number#Deleting Rules by Chain and Number":"Iptables rules can also be removed by their chain and line number.

There is no configuration to reload or daemon to restart. Because of this, you must be very careful, or you could lock yourself out of the system you are using. Rules that let you into the system should always come before those that don’t.\nNote: When working with firewalls, be careful not to block SSH traffic and lock yourself out of your own server (port :22, by default).

Each column’s heading appears on the next line, and then the rules for the chain itself are presented. The following is a breakdown of what each heading means:\ntarget: The target tells the rule what to do if a packet matches the rule. A packet may be granted passage, rejected, recorded, or forwarded to another chain in order to be evaluated against additional rules. Prot: The protocol which could be TCP, UDP, ICMP, or “all.” opt: This column, which shows IP choices, is rarely utilised. source: Indicative of the traffic’s origin IP address or subnet, or any other destination: The packets’ final Internet Protocol (IP) address or subnet, or any other The rule’s alternatives are given in the unlabeled final column.

Learn top and htop.\nNext, learn how to query specific processes.","step2-how-to-list-processes-using-ps#Step.2 How to List Processes Using ps":"top and htop provide a dashboard-like interface for monitoring running processes, comparable to a graphical task manager. A dashboard interface can provide an overview, but it does not typically return directly actionable data. Linux has a second standard tool named ps for querying running processes.\nRunning ps without arguments offers minimal information.\n# ps Output PID TTY TIME CMD 1017 pts/0 00:00:00 bash 1262 pts/0 00:00:00 ps This output lists all processes related to the current user and terminal session. This makes sense if you are simply running the bash shell and this ps command in the terminal at the moment.\nTo obtain a more comprehensive view of this system’s processes, you can do ps aux:\n# ps aux Output USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 1 0.0 0.2 24188 2120 ? Ss 14:28 0:00 /sbin/init root 2 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S 14:28 0:00 [kthreadd] root 3 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S 14:28 0:00 [ksoftirqd/0] root 6 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S 14:28 0:00 [migration/0] root 7 0.0 0.0 0 0 ?

S\u003c 14:28 0:00 [khelper] These parameters instruct ps to display processes owned by all users in a more readable format, regardless of their terminal relationship.\nUsing pipes, grep may be used to scan the output of ps aux in order to return the name of a specific process. This is useful if you suspect the programme has crashed or need to terminate it for whatever reason.\n# ps aux | grep bash Output microhost 41664 0.7 0.0 34162880 2528 s000 S 1:35pm 0:00.04 -bash microhost 41748 0.0 0.0 34122844 828 s000 S+ 1:35pm 0:00.00 grep bash This returns both the recently executed grep process and the currently running bash shell. It also returns their total memory and CPU consumption, how long they’ve been running, and their process ID, which is shown in the result above. Each process in Linux and Unix-like systems is issued a process ID, or PID. This is how the operating system keeps track of and identifies processes.\nThe pgrep command provides a simple method for obtaining a process’s PID.\n# pgrep bash The PID “1” is assigned to the init process, which is the initial process created upon system boot.\n# pgrep init This process spawns all system processes. Later processes have higher PIDs.\nThe process that spawned another is its parent. Parent processes have a PPID, which is visible in top, htop, and ps column headings.\nAny user-OS process communication involves translating process names and PIDs. These tools always output the PID. Next, you’ll learn how to use PIDs to stop, resume, and other processes.","step3-how-to-send-signals-to-processes-in-linux#Step.3 How to Send Signals to Processes in Linux":"Signals control Linux processes. Signals are an OS-level technique of terminating or changing programme behaviour.\nKill is the most common programme signal. This utility’s default function is to kill a process.\n# kill PID_of_target_process It sends the process TERM. Term tells a process to end. So, the software may clean up and quit cleanly.\nIf a misbehaving programme doesn’t exit when given the TERM signal, send the KILL signal.\n# kill -KILL PID_of_target_process A specific signal not sent to the programme.\nThe process is shut down by the operating system kernel. This bypasses programmes that disregard signal input.\nEvery signal has a number that can be passed instead of the name. You can pass “-15” for “-TERM” and “-9” for “-KILL.”\nSignals don’t just stop programmes. Other actions can be taken with them.\nMany background programmes (called “daemons”) restart when given the HUP, or hang-up, signal. Apache usually works this way.\n# sudo kill -HUP pid_of_apache The command above reloads Apache’s configuration file and resumes service.\n-l lists all kill signals.\n# kill -l Although PIDs are the typical mechanism for transmitting signals, it is also possible to do so using ordinary process names.\nThe pkill command behaves nearly identically to kill, except it operates on a process name.\n# pkill -9 ping The preceding command is equal to:\n# kill -9 pgrep ping The preceding command is equal to:\n# killall firefox This command will deliver the TERM signal to all instances of Firefox currently operating on the system.","step4-modifying-process-priorities#Step.4 Modifying Process Priorities":"You may need to prioritise server processes.\nSome processes may be mission-critical, while others may be run when resources are available.\nNiceness controls Linux’s priority.\nPriority jobs don’t share resources properly, thus they’re less nice. Low priority operations take minimum resources, which is beneficial.\nWhen you run top, there was a “NI” column.

It uses an algorithm to move only the parts of files that have changed, which reduces the amount of data that needs to be copied.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll explain what Rsync is, go over the syntax for using Rsync, show you how to use Rsync to sync with a remote system, and talk about other options you have.\nPrerequisites\nTo practise using rsync to sync files between a local system and a remote system, you’ll need two computers, one to act as your local system and the other as your remote system. As long as they are set up the right way, these two machines could be virtual private servers, virtual machines, containers, or even personal computers.\nIf you want to use servers to follow this guide, it would be smart to give each of them administrative users and set up a firewall. Follow our First Server Setup Guide to set up these servers.\nTo follow this tutorial, you will need to have made SSH keys on both of the machines you use. This is true no matter what kind of machines you use. Then, follow Step 2 of that guide to copy each server’s public key to the authorized keys file of the other server.\nThis guide was tested on computers running Ubuntu 20.04, but it should work on most Linux-based computers with rsync installed if rsync is installed.\nTo Use Rsync to Sync Local and Remote Directories please read the below steps ….","defination-rsync#Defination Rsync":"Rsync is a very flexible tool for synchronising files over a network.

Once SSH access is confirmed between two machines, use the following syntax to sync dir1 to a remote machine. In this example, you’ll omit the trailing slash to transmit the real directory:\n#rsync -a ~/dir1 username@remote_host:destination_directory This technique “pushes” a local directory to a distant machine. Pull syncs a remote directory with the local system. If dir1 were remote, the syntax would be:\n#rsync -a username@remote_host:/home/username/dir1 place_to_sync_on_local_machine Like cp and similar tools, source is always first, destination second.","recognizing-rsync-syntax#Recognizing Rsync Syntax":"rsync’s syntax is similar to that of other tools like ssh, scp, and cp.\nFirst, run the following command to go to your home directory:\n#cd after that create a test directory\n#mkdir dir1 Make a second test directoey:\n#mkdir dir2 Add some test files now:\n#touch dir1/file{1..100} There is currently a dir1 directory with 100 empty files in it.

To sync dir1 to dir2 on the same system, execute rsync with the “recursive” -r flag:\n#rsync -r dir1/ dir2 -a is a combo flag that means “archive.” It syncs recursively and preserves symbolic links, special and device files, modification times, groups, owners, and rights. This flag is preferred over -r. Run the same command with the -a flag:\n#rsync -a dir1/ dir2 Please note that the previous two instructions have a trailing slash (/) after the first argument.\n#rsync -a dir1/ dir2 Trailing slash indicates dir1’s contents. Without the trailing slash, dir1 would be inside dir2. The result is a hierarchy:\nTrailing slash indicates dir1's contents. Without the trailing slash, dir1 would be inside dir2. The result is a hierarchy: Check your rsync command arguments before executing. Using Rsync’s -n or —dry-run option does this. The -v flag, which means “verbose”, is also necessary to get the appropriate output. You’ll combine the a, n, and v flags in the following command:\n#rsync -anv dir1/ dir2 Output sending incremental file list ./ file1 file10 file100 file11 file12 file13 file14 file15 file16 file17 file18 Now compare that output to what you get when you remove the trailing slash, like in:\n#rsync -anv dir1 dir2 Output sending incremental file list dir1/ dir1/file1 dir1/file10 dir1/file100 dir1/file11 dir1/file12 dir1/file13 dir1/file14 dir1/file15 dir1/file16 dir1/file17 dir1/file18 This output shows that the directory was migrated, not just its files.","utilizing-alternative-rsync-methods#Utilizing Alternative Rsync Methods":"Rsync’s flag choices can change the utility’s default behaviour.\nText files that haven’t been compressed can be compressed with the -z option to minimise network transfer.\n#rsync -az source destination Also useful is -P. It’s —progress and —partial. The first flag shows transfer progress, and the second resumes interrupted transfers.\n#rsync -azP source destination #Output sending incremental file list created directory destination source/ source/file1 0 100% 0.00kB/s 0:00:00 (xfr#1, to-chk=99/101) sourcefile10 0 100% 0.00kB/s 0:00:00 (xfr#2, to-chk=98/101) source/file100 0 100% 0.00kB/s 0:00:00 (xfr#3, to-chk=97/101) source/file11 0 100% 0.00kB/s 0:00:00 (xfr#4, to-chk=96/101) source/file12 0 100% 0.00kB/s 0:00:00 (xfr#5, to-chk=95/101) If you execute the command once more, you will see a condensed version of the results because no modifications have been made since the last time. This exemplifies Rsync’s capability of making use of modification times in order to detect whether or not changes have been made:\n#rsync -azP source destination Output sending incremental file list sent 818 bytes received 12 bytes 1660.00 bytes/sec total size is 0 speedup is 0.00 Say you updated several files’ modification time with this command:\n#touch dir1/file{1..10} If you run rsync with -azP again, you’ll see how it intelligently recopies just modified files.\n#rsync -azP source destination #Output sending incremental file list file1 0 100% 0.00kB/s 0:00:00 (xfer#1, to-check=99/101) file10 0 100% 0.00kB/s 0:00:00 (xfer#2, to-check=98/101) file2 0 100% 0.00kB/s 0:00:00 (xfer#3, to-check=87/101) file3 0 100% 0.00kB/s 0:00:00 (xfer#4, to-check=76/101) To sync two directories, delete files from the destination if they’re removed from the source. rsync doesn’t remove files by default.\n—delete modifies this behaviour. Before using this option, use -n, —dry-run, to prevent data loss.\n#rsync -an --delete source destination You can exclude files or directories from a syncing directory by using the —exclude= option and a comma-separated list.\n#rsync -a --exclude=pattern_to_exclude source destination You can override an exclusion pattern with the —include= option.\n#rsync -a --exclude=pattern_to_exclude --include=pattern_to_include source destination The Rsync —backup option stores backups of essential files. It’s used with the —backup-dir option, which defines where backup files go.\n#rsync -a --delete --backup --backup-dir=/path/to/backups /path/to/source destination Rsync simplifies networked file transfers and local directory syncing. Rsync’s versatility makes it useful for many file-level tasks.\nMastering Rsync lets you construct elaborate backups and control how and what is shared.\nHope you have understand the above steps To Use Rsync to Sync Local and Remote Directories\nMust read:- https://utho.com/docs/tutorial/find-multiple-ways-to-user-account-info-and-login-details-in-linux/\nThankyou"},"title":"How To Use Rsync to Sync Local and Remote Directories"},"/docs/linux/how-to-use-the-smtp-server-of-google/":{"data":{"":"","benefits#Benefits":"You can choose to have Google store and index the emails you send through its SMTP server.

By updating PATH, you can execute executables from any directory without inputting the absolute file path.\nInstead of typing:\nTo View and Update the Linux PATH Environment Variable please follow the below steps that will help you to increase you knowledge..\n# /usr/bin/python3 You can type this in its place because the PATH variable includes the /usr/bin directory:\n# python3 Priority directories are listed first.\nThis lesson updates the PATH variable.\nStep.1 Taking a Look at the PATH Variable #echo $PATH Unmodified PATH looks like this (file paths may vary by system):\nOutput /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games PATH includes some default directories, each separated by a colon :. The system checks these folders from left to right when launching an application.\nWhen a command-line programme isn’t in any of the specified folders, you may need to add it to PATH.\nStep.2 Setting the PATH environment variable to include a directory A directory can be added to PATH at the beginning or end.\nAdding a directory to PATH will make it checked first (/the/file/path, for example).\n# export PATH=/the/file/path:$PATH Putting a directory at the end of PATH means it will be checked last.\n# export PATH=$PATH:/the/file/path Multiple directories can be added to PATH by using a colon:\n# export PATH=$PATH:/the/file/path:/the/file/path2 Once the export command is executed, you can view the PATH variable to see the changes:\n# export PATH=$PATH:/the/file/path # echo $PATH You’ll get something like this:\n# Output /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/the/file/path Only the current shell session can use this method. Once you exit and restart, the PATH variable will reset to its default value and no longer contain the added directory. PATH must be stored in a file to persist across shell sessions.\nStep .3 Adding a directory to PATH In this step, you’ll add a directory to the shell configuration file, which is either /.bashrc or /.zshrc, depending on the shell you’re using. In this guide, /.bashrc will be used as an example.\nFirst, open the file called /.bashrc:\n# nano ~/.bashrc /.bashrc has existing info you won’t change. At the bottom of the file, add your new directory:\n# export PATH=$PATH:the/file/path Use the methods in the previous section to specify whether the new directory should be checked first or last.\nClose the file. A fresh shell session will alter the PATH variable. Source command applies modifications to current session.\n# source ~/.bashrc You can add new directories by opening this file and attaching colon-separated directories to the export command.\nHope you have understand the above steps to View and Update the Linux PATH Environment Variable..\nMust read:- https://utho.com/docs/tutorial/cheat-sheet-for-15-nmcli-commands-in-linux-rhel-centos/","step1-taking-a-look-at-the-path-variable#Step.1 Taking a Look at the PATH Variable":"","step2-setting-the-path-environment-variable-to-include-a-directory#Step.2 Setting the PATH environment variable to include a directory":""},"title":"How To View and Update the Linux PATH Environment Variable"},"/docs/linux/how-to-view-colored-man-page-documentation-in-linux/":{"data":{"":"","description#\u003cstrong\u003eDescription\u003c/strong\u003e":"","thank-you#\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e":"\nDescription In this article you will know How you can View Colored Man Page in linux. In computer operating systems that are similar to Unix, the phrase “man page” refers to the documentation that is associated with a terminal-based application, tool, or utility (commonly known as a command). It includes the name of the command, the syntax for using it, an explanation of the possible options, the author, copyright information, related commands, and other information.\nThe following is an example of how to view the manual page for a command in Linux; this will display the man page for the df command:\n# man df The output of the man programme is typically formatted with the help of a terminal pager software such as more or less, and the default display for any kind of text is typically in white colour (bold, underlined etc..).\n*You may get nicely coloured man pages by making simple adjustments to the.bashrc file in your home directory by defining a colour scheme using a variety of LESS TERMCAP variables.\n# vi ~/.bashrc Add the following to your colour scheme. export LESS_TERMCAP_mb=$'e[1;32m' export LESS_TERMCAP_md=$'e[1;32m' export LESS_TERMCAP_me=$'e[0m' export LESS_TERMCAP_se=$'e[0m' export LESS_TERMCAP_so=$'e[01;33m' export LESS_TERMCAP_ue=$'e[0m' export LESS_TERMCAP_us=$'e[1;4;31m' The colour codes that were utilised in the setup that was just shown are shown below.\n31 – red 32 – green 33 – yellow And here are the meanings of the escape codes that were utilised in the setup that was just presented:\n0 – reset/normal 1 – bold 4 – underlined In addition to this, you can restart your terminal by typing reset, or you can switch to a different shell. Now when you try to see a man page for the df command, it should look like this instead of the default view. This view is much nicer.\n# man df You might also use the MOST paging application, which is compatible with operating systems that are similar to Unix and enables you to scroll both left and right as well as supporting multiple windows.\n# yum install most After that, you should include the following line in your /.bashrc file, then source the file as you did before and maybe reset your terminal.\nIn this article, we demonstrated how to colourize the man pages in Linux so that they look more appealing.

Every setup is done via the terminal; make sure that you have logged in as root via SSH. If you have not followed the initiation guide, it is best to do so before this guide begins. Also note that you may want to consider using our CentOS LAMP Guide if you want to mount a full LAMP stack.\nSet the Hostname Please ensure that you follow our instructions for setting your hostname before downloading and configuring the components mentioned in this section. Make sure the following commands are set correctly:\nhostname hostname -f You will show your short hostname in the first command and your fully qualified FQDN domain name in the second command.\nInstall Apache HTTP Server Ensure that your system is up-to-date with a command:\nyum update You will want to make sure your installation of CentOS is configured to allow inbound traffic to port 80; by issuing a shell request, you can customize the built-in firewall.\nType the following order for Apache HTTP Server installation:\nyum install httpd Issue the following web server launch command:\n/etc/init.d/httpd start To make sure that Apache starts after the next reboot process, issue the command below:\nchkconfig httpd on Install Support for Scripting The following commands are optional and should be executed if you need support from Apache in PHP, Ruby, Python or Perl for server-side scripting.\nTo add support for Ruby, please issue the following command:\nyum install ruby Note that only Ruby programming language support is installed. If scripts and applications are to be run in ruby on web pages, some kind of CGI handler will be required.\nIssue the following order to enable Perl support:\nyum install mod_perl To add support for Python, edit the following command:\nyum install mod_python If you need MySQL support in Php, you do need Php MySQL support to install:\nyum install MySQL-python The following command is given to install PHP support, including can support bundles:\nyum install php php-pear If you still plan to run PHP with mysql, then install mySQL support too:\nyum install php-mysql Configure Apache The httpd.conf file located at: /etc / httpd / conf / httpd.conf includes all Apache settings. We recommend that you back up this file to your home directory, as follows:\ncp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf ~/httpd.conf.backup All files in /etc / httpd / conf.d/ ended with the.conf extension are considered by default to be configuration files. We suggest adding the non-standard configuration options into these folders in the directory. Regardless of how you arrange your configuration files, it is strongly recommended that you make frequent backups of established working conditions.\nNow we’re going to set up virtual hosting to host many domains (or subdomains) with the server. Such websites can be managed by different users, or by a single user, if you wish.\nBefore beginning, we recommend you merge all virtual hosting configuration into a single vhost.conf file located in the /etc / httpd / conf.d/ directory. Open this file in your favorite text editor and we’ll continue with virtual hosting setup.\nConfigure Name-based Virtual Hosts First, we have to configure Apache to “listen” only for IP address requests. Apache listens to requests on all IP addresses by default.\nNameVirtualHost \\*:80 Now, for any site you need to host with this api, you can build virtual host entries. Two examples of “example.org” and “example.net” websites are given here:\nServerAdmin admin@example.org ServerName example.org ServerAlias www.example.org DocumentRoot /srv/www/example.org/public_html/ ErrorLog /srv/www/example.org/logs/error.log CustomLog /srv/www/example.org/logs/access.log combined ServerAdmin webmaster@example.net ServerName example.net ServerAlias www.example.net DocumentRoot /srv/www/example.net/public_html/ ErrorLog /srv/www/example.net/logs/error.log CustomLog /srv/www/example.net/logs/access.log combined Notes concerning this configuration example:\nAll files for the pages you are hosting are located in the folders below /srv / www. Such directories can be symbolically connected to other locations if you choose to have them elsewhere. ErrorLog and CustomLog entries are suggested, but are not needed for more fine grained logging. The log directories must be generated before you restart Apache if they are specified (as shown above). Before using the above configuration, you will need to build the necessary folders. The following commands for the above configuration may be used for this:\nmkdir -p /srv/www/example.org/public_html mkdir -p /srv/www/example.org/logs mkdir -p /srv/www/example.net/public_html mkdir -p /srv/www/example.net/logs After your virtual hosts have been set up, first issue the following command to run Apache:\n/etc/init.d/httpd start Virtual domain hosting will now function-if you have configured DNS to show your domain at the IP address of your Instance. Note that as many virtual hosts as you need can be installed with Apache.\nWhenever you have modified an option in your vhost.conf file, remember to reload the configuration with the following command:\n/etc/init.d/httpd reload Configuration Options The huge amount of versatility offered in its configuration files is one of Apache’s strengths and obstacles. The main configuration file is located in /etc / httpd / conf / httpd.conf for the Apache 2 installation in CentOS 5, but the configuration for Apache is also downloaded in a certain order from directories at a variety of different locations. In the following order the configuration files are read, with later items preceding earlier and probably conflicting options listed.\n/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf In order to read.conf files, ordered alphabetically by name of file in /etc / httpd / conf.d/ directory. Note, subsequent files triumph over previously listed files. Files will be read in an order dependent on an alpha-numeric sort of file name in a directory of the specified configuration files.\nApache will follow symbolic links to read configuration files so that you can create links to files which are actually elsewhere in your file system in these directories and locations.\nFor most situations we are advised not modifying the default configuration file for compliance with best practice, because most Apache controls can be handled from files that are included in the conf.d/ directory, and administrators may avoid unintended conflicts. When you want to edit httpd.conf, backup the default set-up file and backups of known working states for your device. In case your modifications render unintended errors, you can easily return your server to a working state.\ncp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd-conf.backup-1 As mentioned above, as in our LAMP guide for CentOS 5.2 configuration files for virtual host sites, you should be able to break site-specific configuration information into additional files, for instance in /etc / httpd / conf.d / vhost.conf.\nInstall Apache Modules One of the key strengths of Apache is its highly versatile configuration. There are few web-serving tasks which Apache can not perform with its support for a large number of modules. The /etc / httpd / modules/ directory is default for the modules. Configuration for standard modules is stored in /etc / httpd / conf / httpd.conf while configuration settings are usually set to .conf files in /etc / httpd / conf.d/ for optional modules that are enabled with Yum.\nCheck for lines beginning with LoadModule statements in the “Conf” files to see if a module is available. A list of currently available modules should be created using the following two grep commands:\ngrep ^LoadModule /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf grep ^LoadModule /etc/httpd/conf.d/* Edit the related file and make a comment on the LoadModule statement by prefixing the line of the hash (e.g. #) for deactivation of an active module (at your own risk).\nUsing the following commands to obtain a list of Apache modules available in the CentOS repository:\nyum search mod_ Each of these modules can then be activated with the command:\nyum install mod_[module-name] The modules should be disabled and prepared for use after installation, but additional settings should be added to allow access to the features of the modules. For more detail on configuring different modules, see the Apache Module Documentation.\nUnderstanding .htaccess Configuration The.htaccess file is a webmaster and developer experience with the Apache configuration gui. In these files, configuration options allow you to monitor the actions of Apache by directory. You can lock a directory behind a password wall to prevent general access to it, for example. Furthermore, the .htaccess specific directory files are common places where URL re-writing rules are defined.\nNote that all directories below the file are protected by options listed in a.htaccess file. In addition, note that the higher level settings can be defined for all options provided in.htaccess files. You can set directory level options using \u003c Directory \u003e blocks within your virtual host if this kind of configuration structure is suitable for your setup.\nPassword Protecting Directories We need to create a.htpasswd file in a non-web accessible directory. For instance, if /srv / www / example.com / public html/ is the root of a video host document, use /srv / www / example.com/. Join the folder:\ncd /srv/www/example.com/ Using the htpasswd command, we will create a new password entry for a user named thisl:\nhtpasswd -c .htpasswd cecil Note, you can specify an alternate name for a password file (e.g .. htpasswd), which might be prudent if you wanted to store a number of.htpasswd files for different directories at the same location.\nThese usernames and passwords do not (and should not) match the usernames and passwords of the system. You can also specify how the passwords are encrypted / hashed with the-m flag for MD5, or-s for SHA hashes. Note that when you add additional users to the.htpasswd file, you should not use the-c option (which creates a new file)\nAdd the following lines to the.htaccess file for the directory you want to protect:\nAuthUserFile /srv/www/example.com/.htpasswd AuthType Basic AuthName \"Advanced Choreographic Information\" Require valid-user Note that the AuthName is presented to the user as an explanation in the authentication dialog for what they are asking to access on the server.\nRewriting URLs with mod_rewrite The mod rewrite engine is very powerful and is available for use by default. Although mod rewrite’s capabilities far exceed the scope of this section, we hope to provide a brief outline and some common use cases.\nEnable mod rewrite with the following line in the \u003c Directory \u003e block or.htaccess file:\nRewriteEngine on Now, a number of separate rewriting rules can be developed. Such rules provide a prototype in which the server compares incoming requests and the server offers an alternate page if a request fits a rewrite pattern. Here is a rewriting rule example:\nRewriteRule ^post-id/([0-9]+)$ /posts/$1.html Let this rule be analyzed. First of all the pattern to suit incoming requests is the first string. Within this second line the files to be handled are listed. Regular expressions are used for patterns in mod rewrite, which means that the ^ matches the beginning and the $matches the end of the string, which implies that the rewriter won’t rewrite strings partially matching the template.\nThis string rewrite all paths that start in /post-id/ with a number (eg. [0-9]+), which represent the corresponding.html file in the /posts/ directory. The word in the template or parenthetic words describes a variable that has been transferred to the second string as $1, $2, $3, etc.\nThere are many other options for using mod rewrite to allow users to see and interact with useful URLs while maintaining a file structure that makes sense from a development or deployment point of view.","set-the-hostname#Set the Hostname":"","understanding-htaccess-configuration#Understanding .htaccess Configuration":""},"title":"Install Apache 2 Web Server in CentOS 5"},"/docs/linux/install-cwp-in-centos-7/":{"data":{"":"CWP is an free and paid license based hosting panel for managing website database,emails,file,etc using a single Panel.

Let’s first learn that SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an Internet security technology based on encryption. It was created by Netscape in 1995 to provide privacy, authentication, and data integrity for Internet interactions. SSL is the forerunner of the current TLS encryption protocol.\nA certificate that is self-signed will encrypt communications between your server and any clients. Users cannot use the certificate to automatically authenticate the identity of your server, since it is not certified by any of the trustworthy certificate authorities available in web browsers.\nIf you do not have a domain name linked with your server and the encrypted web interface is not user-facing, a self-signed certificate may be suitable.","os-and-other-important-files#OS and other important files:":" We have used Ubuntu with Apache2 service Default Configuration file: /etc/apache2/apache.conf SSL Virtual Host file: /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf Steps to install the SSL: Step 1: Install the Apache2 server on your Ubuntu server using the below command.\n[console ]apt install apache2 -y[/console]\nStep 2: Start the Apache2 service on your server so that you can use it\nsystemctl start apache2 Step 3: Now to check whether your apache service is running fine or not, go to browser and search your server ip as shown below\nStep 4: Now if we want to test apache server with a sample source code.

This means that it links each of the Postgres roles to a corresponding Unix or Linux system account. If there is a role within Postgres with the same name as a Unix or Linux username, the user will have the ability to sign in as that role.\nDuring the course of the installation process, a user account with the name postgres was established. This account is linked to the default Postgres role. This account can be used in a number different ways in order to gain access to Postgres. Switching to the postgres account on your server can be done in a number of ways, one of which is to execute the following command:\n#sudo -i -u postgres After that, you can launch the Postgres prompt by typing:\n#psql With the PostgreSQL prompt now open, you can immediately start interacting with the database management system.\nRun these commands to leave the PostgreSQL prompt:\n#q After doing so, you will be brought back to the command prompt for postgres on Linux. Execute the exit command to return to your regular user account on the system:\n#exit You may also access to the Postgres prompt by executing the psql command with the sudo prefix while logged in as the postgres account:\n#sudo -u postgres psql By using this, you can log into Postgres without using a bash shell as a middleman.\nOnce more, you can end the interactive Postgres session by executing the commands below:\n#q "},"title":"Installing PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 20.04: Step-by-Step Instructions"},"/docs/linux/laravel-application-hosting-in-plesk/":{"data":{"":" How to install Laravel Application on Plesk serve\nDescription\nLaravel is an open-source web application framework that simplifies routine tasks that are integral to the majority of web development projects.

Aliases are similar to user-defined shortcuts in that they are used to represent a command (or group of commands) that may be carried out with or without the usage of user-defined parameters. On your Linux system, it is likely that you are already making use of aliases.\n*By running the alias command, you can see a list of the aliases you’ve set up on your profile.\n#alias Here you can see the aliases that Centos 7.3 has already set up for your user.","creating-permanent-aliases#Creating Permanent Aliases":"You may save aliases in your user’s shell configuration profile file to maintain them across sessions.

So, for example, you can use your favourite editor to open a.bashrc file in bash:\n#vi .bashrc Determine where in the file you wish to store the aliases that you have created. One possible location for their addition is at the very end of the file. You are able to include a note before your aliases for organisational reasons, and it should look something like this:\nPlease save the file. The file will be loaded immediately into your next session automatically. You will need to execute the following command in order to utilise the newly created alias in this session:\n#source .bashrc To delete an alias that was added through the command line, the unalias command may be used to remove the alias.\n#unalias alias_name If you want remove all aliases.\n#unalias -a This is a quick example of how to establish an alias for commonly used commands.

Linux is designed to make your computing experience as brisk and productive as it possibly can be. The maximum allowed amount of time is one of the characteristics of a Linux command. Any command that you run can have a timer attached to it if you so choose. If the specified amount of time elapses, the command will no longer be carried out.\nIn this brief tutorial, you are going to learn two different ways that you can implement a time limit into the commands that you write.\nTimeout Tool for Executing Linux Commands You are able to execute a command in Linux with a time limit because the operating system comes with a utility for the command line called a timeout.\nThe following is an example of its syntax:\n#timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]… You must include a timeout value, measured in seconds, along with the command that you want to execute in order to use the command. You could, for instance, run the following command to timeout a ping command after 5 seconds.\n#timeout 5s ping google.com After the number 5, the s is optional. The following command remains the same and continues to function.\n#timeout 5 ping google.com Some other endings are:\nm representing minutes h representing hours d representing days Even after the timeout has sent the initial signal, the commands may continue to run in some circumstances. The —kill-after option is available for use in situations like these.\nHere is the syntax for it.\n#-k, --kill-after=DURATION You are required to provide timeout with a duration so that it is aware after how much elapsed time the kill signal is to be transmitted.\nFor instance, the command that is being displayed will be aborted after a period of 8 seconds.\n#timeout 8s tail -f /var/log/messages The Timeout command is simple to use, while the Timelimit utility is more difficult to understand but provides more customization options. Your requirements will determine which of the available options is the best fit for you to select.

When compared to normal partitions, LVM manages storage in a different and more efficient way.\nLVM takes room from partitions or whole discs (called “Physical Volumes”) and puts it together into a logical container (called a “Volume Group”). Logical Volumes are logical parts that make up the rest of the Volume Group.\nTo put it simply, LVM puts all of your storage space into a pool and lets you use that pool to make volumes (Logical Volumes).\nLVM is better than standard partitions because it gives you more options and freedom. It lets Logical Groups and Logical Volumes be changed in size online. So, if one of your logical sections runs out of room, you can easily make it bigger by using space from the storage pool.\nLayers of LVM LVM adds a layer of abstraction between the physical storage and the file system. This makes it possible to change the size of the file system, spread it over multiple physical discs, and use any amount of disc space.\nLVM makes divisions with three layers of abstraction.\nPhysical Volume, Volume Group, and Logical Volume.\nPHYSICAL VOLUME\nEverything starts with a disk. The physical volume is the first layer of abstraction that LVM uses to find the disk that has been marked for LVM actions. To put it simply, your disk should be set up as the physical drive if you want to work with LVM. It can be a whole hard drive or normal partitions made from that hard drive.\nVOLUME GROUP\nAll the actual volume is added up to make the volume group. Let’s say you have five disks that are each 1 TB in size. First, you will set up the five disks as real volumes, and then you will add them to the volume group.\nVolume group will hold 5TB of space, which is how much room is available from all the physical volumes. You can set up logical splits from the volume group.\nLOGICAL VOLUMES\nYou can make reasonable volumes out of the pool of space (Volume Group). Think of this as being the same as a typical disk divided.\nStep 1: Set the physical volume to zero I added three different-sized disks, and the total is 10G.\n# lsblk /dev/vd\\[b-e\\] Use the pvcreate command with the name of the device as the argument to set up a disk as a physical volume.\n# pvcreate /dev/vdb /dev/vdc /dev/vdd You can run any of the following tools to see a list of physical volumes. Different things will come out of each order.\nPVDISPLAY: The pvdisplay tool will tell you all about each physical volume, including which volume group it belongs to, its unique ID, and how much space it has.\n# pvdisplay PVS and PVSCAN are two tools that will tell you things like the size of the physical volume, the size of the volume group, and the size of the free space.\n# pvs # pvscan Step 2: Building combined a volume group Now I have three disks set up as a single physical drive that is 10GB in size. You should add these physical disks to a storage pool called a volume group.\nTo make a volume group, use the vgcreate command. You have to give the volume group a name. “utho_files” is the name of the volume group in this case.\n# vgcreate utho\\_files /dev/vd\\[b-d\\] Use any of the following commands to find out more about a volume group.\n# vgdisplay # vgdisplay utho\\_files Step 3: Show Volume Group Information The vgs and vgscan commands will tell you about all of the available volume groups, the amount of physical volumes and logical volumes, as well as the size of the allocated and free space in the volume group.\n# vgs # vgscan Step 4: Create Logical volumes I already said that logical volumes are like disk sections. Now, the “utho_files” pool (volume group) has almost 10GB of free room. On top of this volume group, we’ll build logical volumes, format the volume with the ext4 file system, mount and use the volume.\nYou can use the lvcreate command to make the logical disk. Here is a general description of how the lvcreate tool works.\n# lvcreate -L \u003cvolume-size\u003e -n \u003clogical-volume-name\u003e \u003cvolume-group\u003e Here,\n-L \u003cvolume-size\u003e =\u003e size in KB, MB, GB\n-n \u003clogical-volume-name\u003e =\u003e Name for your volume\n\u003cvolume-group\u003e =\u003e Which volume group to be used\nNow I am creating a logical volume with 3GB size. I named the logical volume “guide”.\n# lvcreate -L 3GB -n guide utho\\_files Step 5: Display information of logical volumes You can use any of the following commands to see details about logical volumes.\nThe lvdisplay command gives you specific information about the logical volume, the associated volume group, the volume size, the logical volume path, and so on.\n# lvdisplay # lvdisplay guide The lvscan and lvs commands will also give you some basic details about the logical volumes.\n# lvscan # lvs Step 6 - Format and Mount the Logical Volumes You need to set up a file system on the logical disk and mount it. Here, I’m using the ext4 file system to format the disk and mounting it under the /mnt/ directory.\nUnder /dev/volume-group/logical-volume, you should see the device file for logical volume. My device file will be called /dev/utho_files/guide.\n# mkfs.ext4 /dev/utho\\_files/guide Run the following command to mount the path. You can put the directory wherever you want to.\n# mount /dev/utho\\_files/guide /mnt/ To see the volumes that are mounted, run:\n# mount | grep -i guide You can also type df to get information about the mounted file system. You can see that the name of the file system is “volume name.” With these names, it will be easy for you to figure out what the base volume is and what its group is.\n# df -h /mnt/ You need to add an entry to the fstab in order to make the mount permanent even after you reboot the system."},"title":"Logical volume manager in linux (LVM) Guide for beginners"},"/docs/linux/mariadb-installation-on-centos-8/":{"data":{"":"\nDescription\nA wide variety of applications, including data warehousing, e-commerce, enterprise-level functionality, and logging programmes, make use of the MariaDB database.

This account has complete read, write, and execute rights for all files and commands on a system, giving it access to all the system has to offer. It may be used to conduct any sort of action on a system; for example, it can be used to create/update/access/delete other users’ accounts, install/remove/upgrade software packages, and so much more.\nBecause the root user has absolute privileges, all acts he/she takes are essential on a system. In this aspect, any faults committed by the root user might have significant repercussions for the system’s ability to function normally. In addition, this account may potentially be exploited by using it incorrectly or inappropriately either unintentionally, deliberately, or via faked ignorance of regulations.\nAs a result, it is recommended that you disable root access on your Linux server. As an alternative, you should create an administrative account that should be configured to gain root user privileges by using the sudo command. This account should then be used to carry out essential tasks on the server.\nIn this post, we will describe four methods to prevent root user account login in Linux.\n**NOTE:**Be careful to establish an administrative account using the useradd command that can utilise sudo to achieve root user rights before you limit access to the root account. Then, give this user account a strong password. Create User’s Home Directory is what the option -m does, and -c enables you to write a comment:\n# useradd -m -c \"Admin User\" microhost_com # passwd microhost_com Next, add this user to the right group of system administrators by using the usermod command with the -a and -G switches (wheel or sudo, depending on your Linux distribution):\n#usermod -aG wheel microhost_com Once a user with administrative capabilities has been established, switch to that account to prevent root access.\n# su microhost_com Change the root user’s shell. The most straightforward way to block root user login is to alter its shell from /bin/bash or /bin/bash (or any other shell that permits user login) to /sbin/nologin, in the /etc/passwd file, which you can open for editing using any of your favorite command line editors as shown.\n# sudo vim /etc/passwd Modify this line:\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash to root:x:0:0:root:/root:/sbin/nologin Save and close the file.\nWhen a root user checks in from now on, he or she will get the notification “This account is presently not available.” This is the default message, but you may customise it by editing the file /etc/nologin.txt.\nThis strategy works only with programmes that require a shell for user login; otherwise, sudo, ftp, and email clients can gain access to the root account.","disabl-ssh-root-login#Disabl SSH Root Login":"The commonest approach to getting to far off servers or VPSs is by means of SSH and to hinder root client login under it, you really want to alter the/and so /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.\n# sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config Then uncomment (in the event that it is remarked) the order PermitRootLogin and set its worth to no as displayed in the screenshot.\nWhenever you are finished, save and close the document.

Deploy a new Microhost Cloud instance":"\nThis tutorial will walk you through the suggested process for Migrate your Google Cloud Platform to Microhost Cloud.\nThe most typical method for moving websites from one hosting provider to another is to:\nCreate an instance of your services on Microhost Cloud, and then transfer over just the configuration and data that is relevant to those instances. As a consequence, this produces a Linux environment that has a 100% chance of starting up properly on the Microhost Cloud platform.\nEven while reinstalling your services might be a time-consuming process, any difficulties that arise when you are configuring your apps are often far simpler to debug than problems with low-level setup. When it comes to migration, this is the preferred technique.\nSteps to follow 1. Deploy a new Microhost Cloud instance When building a new Microhost Cloud, there are two factors to think about: the first is in which data centre the instnace should be located, and the second is the hardware resource plan the instance should operate under.\nLocation of Data Center\nWhen determining the bandwidth available between your location and the data centre, it is helpful to compare the speeds of download. These comparisons will indicate the latency between where you are located and the data centre; ideally, the latency should be as low as possible. Configuration of cloud instance\nChoose a plan that has a minimum amount of storage space that is sufficient for the data that is currently being stored on the GCP VM instance that you are using. Find out the Linux distribution the instance you currently have running on GCP is using, and install it on your new Microhost cloud. If your existing deployment utilises an earlier version of a Linux distribution, you should deploy the most recent version of that distribution that is available for your new cloud. This will guarantee that you have access to the most recent security upgrades and applications.\nPlease refer to guide of how to create Microhost Cloud server for further information on the deployment of your new Linux image. ","2--install-required-software-on-your-cloud-server#2- Install required software on your Cloud server":"Install the exact same software stack onto your new Microhost cloud server that is already running on your existing GCP instance. You may get a list of all installed packages by using the package manager that is associated with your GCP instance. For instance, if you are operating with Debian or Ubuntu, you may type in the following command:\n# apt list --installed And if you are operating with Redhat or CentOS machine:\n# yum list --installed You may refer to our Documents and Tutorials to learn how to set up your system’s software on your new cloud instance once you have determined which software you would want to move to your new Microhost Cloud server and after you have decided which software you would like to migrate.","3--identify-your-configuration-files-and-database-files#3- Identify your configuration files and database files":"Which of the software configuration options have to be kept (e.g. web server, virtual host information, database connection settings, and which files contain these settings, etc.).\nThe location on the disc where your data is stored (e.g. as files in a directory, in a database process, etc.).\nIt is quite probable that you will want a database dump in order to retrieve your data if it is stored in a database.

The simplest and fastest way to modify these file permissions is to use the chmod command.\nHow to Use chmod Chmod refers in this guide to recent chmod versions, like those provided by the GNU project. By default, chmod is included with all microhost images and included in the common “base” selection of packages available in almost all Linux-based operating system distributions.\nLinux File Permission Basics All Unix-like file system object is allowed to read, write, and execute access to three major types of permissions. The three possible classes are authorized: the user, the user group and all system users.\nUse to view a set of files’ file permissions:\n[root@Microhost ~]# ls -lha There are ten characters representing the permission bits in the first column of the output.

The remaining nine bits in three groups represent the user, group and worldwide permissions. Everyone means:\nr: Read w: Write x: eXecute [ht_message mstyle=“alert” title=“NOTE” \" show_icon=“true” id=\"\" class=““style=”” ]Note that access to files targeted by symbolic links is controlled by the permissions of the targeted file, not the permissions of the link object..[/ht_message]\nchmod Command Syntax and Options The chmod command format is the following:\n[root@Microhost ~]# chmod [who][+,-,=][permissions] filename Consider the chmod command below :\n[root@Microhost ~]# chmod g+w ~/microhost.txt This allows all user groups who have written permissions to the ~/microhost.txt file. Additional options for modifying targeted user permissions are:\nThe operator + allows, while the operator - removes permissions.you are also allowed to copy permissions:\n[root@Microhost ~]# chmod g=u ~/microhost.txt The parameter g=u means grant group permissions to be same as the user’s.\nThe following example can specify multiple allowances by separating with a comma:\n[root@Microhost ~]# chmod g+w,o-rw,a+x ~/microhost.txt In this way, the user groups add written permissions and remove reading and writing permissions from the “other” system users. Finally, a+x gives all categories execute permissions. This value can also be set to + x. In the absence of a category, all permission categories shall be added or withdrawn.\nIn this notation, the owner of the file is referred to as the user (e.g. u+x).\n[root@Microhost ~]# chmod -R +w,g=rw,o-rw, ~/microhost.txt The -R option applies the amendment of permissions to the specified directory and all its contents recursively.\nHow to Use Octal Notation for File Permissions Octal notation is another way of setting permissions.\nThe following is an instance of a file authorization equivalent to chmod u=rwx, g=rx, o =\n[root@Microhost ~]# chmod 750 /microhost.txt The permissions for this file are - rwx r-x ---.\nWithout considering the first bit, every bit with a-can be replaced with a 0 while r, w, or x is 1. The conversion is as follows:\nThe two other digits are separate from each other. Thus, 750 means the user could read , write or run, the group could not write, and other users could not read , write or run.\n744, the default type permit allows the user to read , write and execute licenses and group and “world” user read permissions.\nEither notation is equivalent and any form that expresses your permission requirements can be used more clearly.\nMaking a File Executable The following examples change the file permissions so that any user can execute the file “~/microhost-project.py”:\nchmod +x ~/microhost-project.py\nThank You :)"},"title":"Modify File Permissions with chmod"},"/docs/linux/most-common-network-port-numbers-for-linux/":{"data":{"":"A port is a logical address that is typically assigned to a specific service or running application on a computer , and more specifically, TCP/IP and UDP networks.

NAT Gateway plays a vital role in achieving this by seamlessly connecting your cloud resources to the internet while maintaining security and privacy. Join us as we explore the ins and outs of NAT Gateway and how it enhances your cloud networking experience.\nWhat does Cloud NAT entail? Cloud NAT, or Network Address Translation, is a service provided by cloud computing platforms like Google Cloud Platform. It enables virtual machine instances without external IP addresses to access the internet, as well as providing a means for instances with external IP addresses to communicate with those without.\nIn simpler terms, Cloud NAT allows virtual machines (VMs) in a cloud environment to connect to the internet or other resources outside of their network, even if they don’t have their own unique public IP address. Instead, Cloud NAT assigns a single public IP address to multiple VM instances within a private network, translating their internal IP addresses to the public one when accessing external services. This helps with security and efficiency by reducing the number of publicly exposed IP addresses while still allowing for internet connectivity.\nWhat are the primary benefits of using a NAT Gateway in cloud networking architectures? Using a NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway in cloud networking architectures offers several key benefits:\nEnhanced Security: NAT Gateway acts as a barrier between your private subnet and the internet, hiding the actual IP addresses of your resources. This adds a layer of security by preventing direct access to your internal network.\nSimplified Network Management: It simplifies outbound internet connectivity by providing a single point for managing traffic from multiple instances in a private subnet. You don’t need to assign public IP addresses to each instance, reducing management overhead.\nCost-Effectiveness: NAT Gateway allows you to consolidate outbound traffic through a single IP address, which can be more cost-effective than assigning public IP addresses to each instance. This can result in savings, especially in scenarios with multiple instances requiring internet access.\nScalability: NAT Gateway can handle high volumes of outbound traffic and automatically scales to accommodate increased demand without intervention. This scalability ensures that your network remains responsive even during peak usage periods.\nImproved Performance: By offloading the task of address translation to a dedicated service, NAT Gateway can improve network performance and reduce latency compared to performing NAT functions on individual instances.\nOverall, integrating a NAT Gateway into your cloud networking architecture enhances security, simplifies management, reduces costs, and improves scalability and performance, making it a valuable component for cloud-based infrastructure.\nWhat are some real-world examples or use cases that illustrate the significance of NAT Gateway in contemporary cloud networking configurations? Real-world examples and use cases showcasing the importance of Network Address Translation Gateway in modern cloud networking setups include:\nSecure Internet Access: In a cloud environment hosting web applications, a NAT Gateway can ensure secure outbound internet access for instances in private subnets. This prevents direct exposure of internal resources to the internet while allowing them to access necessary external services, such as software updates or API endpoints.\nMulti-tier Applications: For multi-tier applications where different components reside in separate subnets (e.g., web servers in a public subnet and database servers in a private subnet), a NAT Gateway facilitates communication between these tiers while maintaining security. The web servers can access the internet via the NAT Gateway for updates or third-party services without exposing the database servers to external threats.\nHybrid Cloud Connectivity: Organizations with hybrid cloud architectures, where on-premises resources are integrated with cloud infrastructure, often use NAT Gateway to enable outbound internet connectivity for cloud-based resources while ensuring communication with on-premises systems remains secure.\nManaged Services Access: When utilizing managed services like AWS Lambda or Amazon S3 from instances in a private subnet, a NAT Gateway allows these instances to access the internet for invoking serverless functions, storing data, or retrieving configuration information without exposing them directly to the public internet.\nCompliance and Regulatory Requirements: In industries with strict compliance or regulatory requirements, such as healthcare or finance, NAT Gateway helps maintain security and compliance by controlling outbound traffic and providing a centralized point for monitoring and auditing network activity.\nThese examples highlight how NAT Gateway plays a crucial role in facilitating secure, controlled, and compliant communication between resources in cloud networking environments, making it an essential component of modern cloud architectures.\nHow does combining NAT Gateway with services like load balancers or firewall rules bolster network resilience and security? Integrating NAT Gateway with other cloud networking services, such as load balancers or firewall rules, enhances overall network resilience and security through several mechanisms:\nLoad Balancers: NAT Gateway can be integrated with load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances in a private subnet. This integration ensures that inbound requests are evenly distributed while maintaining the security of internal resources by hiding their IP addresses. In the event of instance failure, the load balancer automatically routes traffic to healthy instances, improving application availability and resilience.\nFirewall Rules: By incorporating NAT Gateway with firewall rules, organizations can enforce fine-grained access controls and security policies for outbound traffic. Firewall rules can be configured to restrict outbound communication to authorized destinations, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating the risk of data exfiltration or malicious activity. Additionally, logging and monitoring capabilities provided by firewall rules enhance visibility into outbound traffic patterns, facilitating threat detection and incident response.\nNetwork Segmentation: NAT Gateway integration with network segmentation strategies, such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering or transit gateway, enables organizations to create isolated network segments with controlled communication pathways. This segmentation enhances security by limiting lateral movement of threats and reducing the attack surface. NAT Gateway serves as a gateway between segmented networks, enforcing access controls and ensuring secure communication between authorized endpoints.\nVPN and Direct Connect: NAT Gateway can be utilized in conjunction with VPN (Virtual Private Network) or Direct Connect services to establish secure, encrypted connections between on-premises infrastructure and cloud resources. This integration extends the organization’s network perimeter to the cloud while maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. NAT Gateway facilitates outbound internet access for VPN or Direct Connect connections, allowing on-premises resources to securely access cloud-based services and applications.\nOverall, the integration of NAT Gateway with other cloud networking services strengthens network resilience and security by providing centralized control, granular access controls, and secure communication pathways for inbound and outbound traffic. This comprehensive approach ensures that organizations can effectively protect their infrastructure and data assets in the cloud environment.\nHow does the cost structure for utilizing a NAT Gateway compare across different cloud service providers, and what factors influence these costs? The cost structure for using a NAT Gateway varies across different cloud service providers and is influenced by several factors:\nUsage Rates: Cloud providers typically charge based on the amount of data processed or bandwidth utilized by the NAT Gateway. This can vary depending on the region, with different rates for inbound and outbound data transfer.\nInstance Type: Some cloud providers offer different instance types for NAT Gateway, each with varying performance characteristics and associated costs. Choosing the appropriate instance type based on your workload requirements can impact the overall cost.\nData Transfer Pricing: In addition to NAT Gateway usage rates, data transfer pricing for transferring data between the NAT Gateway and other cloud resources, such as instances or external services, may apply. Understanding the data transfer pricing structure is essential for accurately estimating costs.\nHigh Availability Configuration: Deploying NAT Gateway in a high availability configuration across multiple availability zones may incur additional costs. Cloud providers may charge for redundant resources or data transfer between availability zones.\nData Processing Fees: Some cloud providers impose data processing fees for certain types of network traffic, such as processing NAT Gateway logs or performing network address translation operations.\nDiscounts and Savings Plans: Cloud providers often offer discounts or savings plans for long-term commitments or predictable usage patterns. Taking advantage of these discounts can help reduce the overall cost of utilizing Network Address Translation Gateway.\nComparing the cost structures of NAT Gateway across different cloud service providers involves evaluating these factors and determining which provider offers the most cost-effective solution based on your specific requirements and usage patterns.\nHow does Utho Cloud improve network connectivity and security for businesses in the cloud with its NAT Gateway services?

Creating a “Hello, World” Program":"\nIntroduction The Python programming language is an increasingly popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers. Flexible and versatile, Python has strengths in scripting, automation, data analysis, machine learning, and back-end development.\nPrerequisite On an Ubuntu 22.04 server, you will need a super user such as root or any non-root user with sudo privileges in order to follow this tutorial.\n1. Setup Python3 Python 3 comes pre-installed on Ubuntu 22.04 and other Debian Linux distributions. To ensure your versions are current, you should update your local package index\n# apt update Then upgrade the packages installed on your system to ensure you have the latest versions\n# apt upgrade -y Once the process is complete, check the version of Python 3 that is installed in the system by running the following\n# python3 -V output\nLet’s install pip, a tool for installing and managing programming packages we might want to use in our development projects, to manage Python software packages.\n# apt install -y python3-pip The following can be used to install Python packages:\n# pip3 install package_name Here, package name can be any Python package or library, like Django for web development or NumPy for scientific computing. So, if you want to install NumPy, you can use the command pip3 install numpy to do so.\nSimilarly, if you are venturing into python-based web scraping, you might find libraries like Scrapy or BeautifulSoup useful. However, modern-day web scraping has evolved to match with robust website anti-bot measures. Take ZenRows for instance, it’s a next-generation web scraping API that takes care of everything from rotating proxies to bypassing advanced anti-bot systems, easing the task for programmers. It’s a valuable tool to have in your python web scraping toolkit.\nYou still need to install a few more packages and development tools to make sure that your programming environment is set up well.\n# apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev After setting up Python and installing pip and other tools, you can set up a virtual environment for your development projects.\n2. Setting Up a Virtual Environment Using virtual environments, you can give each of your Python projects its own space on your server. This way, each project can have its own set of dependencies that won’t affect any of your other projects.\nSetting up a programming environment gives you more control over Python projects and how different versions of packages are handled. This is very important when working with packages from other companies.\nAs many Python programming environments as you want can be set up. Each environment is basically a directory or folder on your server that has a few scripts in it to make it work as an environment.\nWhile there are a few ways to achieve a programming environment in Python, we’ll be using the venv module here, which is part of the standard Python 3 library. Let’s install venv by running the following:\n# apt install -y python3-venv Once this is set up, you can start making environments. Let’s choose which directory we want to put our Python programming environments in, or use mkdir to make a new directory, as in:\n# mkdir environments Then go to the directory where you’ll keep your programming environments:\n# cd environments Once you are in the directory where you want the environments to live, you can run the following command to create an environment:\n# python3 -m venv my_env Basically, pyvenv creates a new directory with a few files that we can look at with the ls command:\n# ls my_env These files work together to make sure that your projects are separated from the rest of your server, so that system files and project files don’t get mixed up. This is a good way to keep track of versions and make sure that each of your projects can use the packages it needs.\nTo use this environment, you need to turn it on. You can do this by typing the following command, which runs the activate script:\n# source my_env/bin/activate Your environment’s name, in this case my env, will now appear at the beginning of your command prompt. Your prefix may look a little different depending on which version of Debian Linux you are using, but the name of your environment in parentheses should be the first thing you see on your line:\n(my_env) root@ubuntu:~/environments$\nThis prefix tells us that the environment my env is currently running. This means that when we make programmes here, they will only use the settings and packages for this environment.\nAfter following these steps, your virtual environment is ready to use.\n3. Creating a “Hello, World” Program Now that we’ve set up our virtual environment, let’s make a simple “Hello, World!” programme. This will let us try out our environment and give us a chance to learn more about Python, if we don’t already.\nTo do this, open up a command line text editor such as vi and create a new file:\n# vi helloworld.py Once the text file opens in the terminal window, type out the programme:\nprint(\"Hello, World!\") Once you exit the editor and return to your shell, you can run the program:\n# python hello.py The output of the hello.py programme you made should look like this in your terminal:\nHello, World! Type the command deactivate to leave the environment and go back to your original directory.","introduction#Introduction":"","prerequisite#Prerequisite":""},"title":"Python 3 Installation and Programming Environment Configuration on an Ubuntu 22.04"},"/docs/linux/rhel/":{"data":{"":" Overview Get Started Guides Resources Developers Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

"},"title":"RHEL"},"/docs/linux/rhel/an-introduction-to-the-linux-alternatives-command/":{"data":{"":" An introduction to the Linux alternatives command\nThis tutorial is to about the introduction of to the Linux alternatives command. Alternatives is a program that adds, deletes, updates, and displays data on the symbolic links that make up the alternatives system.\nBecause many users don’t care how their computer completes a job as long as it is successful, abstractions may be useful to users. In reality, as long as all of an application’s system calls are properly responded, it doesn’t always matter how anything is accomplished. Theoretically, a Linux system administrator may provide a wide range of system utilities based on their functions rather than the precise name of the executable, but doing so often requires a lot of symlinking and version management. Unless you use the alternatives command, that is.\nIt’s important to note that the alternatives command first existed as a substitute. This was originally an update-alternatives convenience tool from the Debian Linux project, written in Perl. The command was rewritten by Red Hat without the use of Perl, and it has since spread across Fedora-based distributions like Red Hat and CentOS as well as other distributions that rely on Red Hat to provide the functional definition of the Linux Standard Base (LSB).","check-alternatives#Check Alternatives":"Other advantages of the alternatives command include the ability to symlink dependent components when a certain option is selected. Alternatives keeps your discrepancies consolidated while while doing a lot of the hard work. To avoid having to always remember that emacs is really emacs-26.3 or that java is actually /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.232.b09-0, etc., you may check in on what alternatives are available:\nalternatives --list Now, you have a learned the introduction of Linux alternatives command. The alternatives command is an illustration of how both users and administrators can profit from some deft manipulation since Linux is all about choice and flexibility.\nMust Read: What are Runlevels in Linux and its understanding.","creating-a-new-alternative#Creating a new alternative":"It is simple to generate an alternative entry using the example situation of an old binary named em being replaced by the new variation nem. Although in most cases this isn’t required since the command isn’t precisely what people assume it is in the first place (java, for example, is seldom found under /usr/bin directly), you must rename the original command in this example. If you do need to rename a binary, the proper place to do so is in the binary’s RPM spec file so that the command to install the RPM supplies the binary with the new name.\nIn a pinch, particularly if you’re planning to phase the command out anyway, you could remove it from the system’s package management and just maintain a customised version of the old command accessible via /opt or something like.\nTake the original editor, which you have called em2, for this example (denoting its latest version number).\nNow, you may associate two binaries (em2 and nem) with the command em. Assume that em and nem are both little Emacs-style editors to help keep the terminology distinctions clear. In that instance, for the sake of simplicity, a very general word for the new alternative would be emacs (using the symbol to signify “micro”) or uemacs.\nOffer the following as a replacement for the original:\na location for the “generic” symlink a name for the alternative (I’ve decided upon uemacs, to make it clear that it’s a reference name rather than a specific binary) the binary to be executed when these symlinks are called a priority level to indicate which alternative is preferred alternatives --install /usr/bin/em uemacs /opt/em-legacy/em2 1 Since the new binary is your preferred binary, develop a high priority replacement:\nalternatives --install /usr/bin/em uemacs /usr/local/bin/nem 99 With the help of these commands, a new symbolic link, /usr/bin/em, is created that points to /etc/alternatives/em, which in turn can point to either /opt/em-legacy/em2 or /usr/local/bin/nem. The systems administrator chose the descriptive and memorable term uemacs as the human-friendly name for this collection of alternatives at random. Using the —config option, you can select the alternate symlink’s destination:\nalternatives --config uemacs There are 2 programs which provide 'uemacs'. Selection Command ----------------------------------------------- *+ 1 /usr/local/bin/nem 2 /opt/em-legacy/em2 ","removing-an-alternative#Removing an alternative":"Alternatives may assist users or administrators move to something new or they might be long-term solutions. Using the —remove-all option and the alternative’s “generic” name will eliminate all alternatives if you need to for whatever reason. Uemacs is used as an example here:\nalternatives --remove-all uemacs This deletes the symlink in /usr/bin and /etc/alternatives as well as everything else related to uemacs from the alternatives subsystem. Use the —remove option with the alternative name (in this case, uemacs) and the path of the choice you wish to drop if you only want to remove one option from an alternative:\nalternatives --remove uemacs /opt/em-legacy/em2 ","when-to-use-the-alternatives-command#When to use the alternatives command":"An easy-to-understand and practical example is the em command on your computer, which starts a simple text editor. It has long been the editor of choice for your user base; many individuals have built processes around it, and some people keep very specific configurations for it. Although em doesn’t support Unicode, your user base lately made it apparent to you that they can’t function without emoji functionality in their terminal editors.\nYou discover nem, a Unicode-capable branch of em, but you are aware that 99% of your customers are already used to em, have scripts that call em, and will never stop thinking of any alternative programme as em. The simple answer to this problem, as well as many others like it, is to provide the new nem binary as the preferred substitute for the em binary whenever the em command is used.\nAlthough manually constructing a symlink could seem alluring, it is neither centralised nor immune to changes from a package management.\nWhen handling “generic” application names, the alternatives command is most helpful. As “generic” isn’t usually generic in the UNIX world, just as “Kleenex” or “Xerox” isn’t always generic in the actual world, terminology like java, (x)emacs(-nox), (n)vi(m), whois, and iptables are often among of the first to have replacements specified for them. The alternatives command is not seen as a suitable option for really general names, such as EDITOR and CC. Because they are environment variables and need to be specified in /etc or $HOME/.profile, those phrases."},"title":"An introduction to the Linux alternatives command"},"/docs/linux/rhel/blah/":{"data":{"":" Overview Get Started Guides Resources Developers Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

We do not, however, have the option on a directory basis for defining options. Thankfully, Apache provides more configuration possibilities.\nThis article deals with many ways of configuring the web server per directory and per file level in very narrow terms. See our other Apache configuration guidelines or official Apache documentation for more information on different options","additional-information#Additional Information":" Directory blocks can’t be nested within each other. Blocks can be nested in the directory inside the blocks \u003cVirtualHost\u003e. The wildcard character can contain the path contained in a directory block. The asterisk matches any character sequence, and a question mark matches any character. This may be helpful if you need a DocumentRoot option for all virtual hosts to control: Directory /srv/www/\\*/public_html ","directory-and-options#Directory and Options":"The \u003cDirectory\u003e block refers to the filesystem directory and defines the behavior of Apache. This block is in angle brackets and begins with “Directory” and the directory path within the file system. The directory and its sub directories as defined are the options set in a directory block. An example of a directory block is the following:\nOrder Allow,Deny Allow from all Deny 55.1 ","file-and-location-options#File and Location Options":"File Options Use the \u003cFiles\u003e command if you need additional control over those files in a directory of your server. The web server behavior for a single file is governed by this directive. Every file with the given name is subject to the \u003cFiles\u003e directives. For example, any file called roster.htm in a file system is protected by the following example directive:\nOrder Allow,Deny Deny from all If the \u003cVirtualHost\u003e block is present, all files called roster.htm would have to be included in DocumentRoot or in DocumentRoot directories. This may apply. When the\u003cFiles\u003e directive is enclosed in the\u003cDirectory\u003e section, all roster.htm files within or inside the directory sub-directories of the specified directory are subject to the options defined.\nLocation Options Although \u003cDirectory\u003e and \u003cFiles\u003e block the behavior of Apache for filesystem locations, the \u003cLocation\u003e directive controls the behavior of Apache in relation to the specific route that the client asks for. If a user requests http://www.abc.com/webmail/inbox/, the web server must look at/srv/www/abc.com/public_html/webmail/inbox/in the webmail/inbox/ directories of the DocumentRoot. One common use for this function is to allow a script to process requests made on a given path. For example, this block directs all path requests to a mod_python script:\nSetHandler python-program PythonHandler modpython PythonPath \"['/srv/www/abc.com/application/inbox'] + sys.path\" Note, after the options in the \u003cDirectory\u003e blocks defined, the options defined in the \u003cLocation\u003e directive are processed and can override any options set in these blocks.","match-directives-and-regular-expressions#Match” Directives and Regular Expressions":"Apache also allows server administrators some additional flexibility in how folders, files, and positions are defined, in addition to the simple guidelines mentioned above. These “Match” blocks allow administrators to define one set of configuration options for a directory, file, and location class. Take an example here:\nOrder Allow,Deny Allow from all Deny 55.1 This block defines a set of options for any directory that matches the standard ^.+/images expression. In other words, any path which begins with a number of characters and ends with images will match these options, including the following paths: /srv/www/abc.com/public_html/images/, /srv/www/abc.com/public_html/objects/images, and /home/username/public/www/images.\nApache also allows an alternate syntax for defining paths within a standard directory block using regular expressions. Adding a tilde (e.g. ~) between Directory and the path causes the specified path to be read as a regular expression. Regular expressions are a basic pattern matching syntax, and normal and custom expression variants are provided by Apache, and Perl.\nThe following block is equivalent to the previous block while DirectoryMatch is preferred:\nOrder Allow,Deny Allow from all Deny 55.1 Apache offers similar features to link a class of locations or files to a single collection of configuration directives using regular expressions. Consequently any of the following choices define appropriate configurations:\nOrder allow,deny Deny from all Order allow,deny Deny from all Order Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow 192. Order Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow 192.168 The directives above for \u003cFiles\u003e and \u003cFilesMatch\u003e are similar to those for \u003cLocation\u003e and \u003cLocationMatch\u003e.","order-of-precedence#Order of Precedence":"With so many different configuration options locations, one option can be listed in one file or block only later to find it overridden by another. One of the key challenges of using the Apache HTTP server is how all the configuration choices that are disparately placed combine to generate different web server behaviors.\nThe following list offers a guide to the priority Apache uses when combining configuration options. Later operations can override options specified earlier.\n1. Blocks are first read in \u003cDirectory\u003e.\n2. .htaccess files are read simultaneously with \u003cDirectory\u003e blocks, but can override the options defined in \u003cDirectory\u003e blocks if AllowOverride option allows.\n3. Next read: \u003cDirectoryMatch\u003e and \u003cDirectory ~\u003e.\n4. \u003cFiles\u003e and \u003cFilesMatch\u003e are read after defining directory behaviors.\n5. Finally, one reads \u003cLocation\u003e and \u003cLocationMatch\u003e.\nIn general, the choices \u003cDirectory\u003e are sorted in sequence from the shortest to the longest. In other words, before setting options for/srv/www/abc.com/public_html/objects , options for/srv/www/abc.com/public_html/objects/imageswill be handled regardless of the order they appear in the configuration file. All other instructions are interpreted in the order in the configuration file they appear in.\nThankyou….","override-options-with-htaccess#Override Options with htaccess":"In addition to the above listed configuration methods, Apache reads configuration options by default for a directory from a file in that directory. This file is commonly known as.htaccess. Look for your httpd.conf and related files for the following configuration options:\nAccessFileName .htaccess Order allow,deny Deny from all The first line tells Apache to view configuration options in publicly available directories in.htaccess files. The second directive \u003cFiles ~ \"^\\.ht\"\u003e tells Apache to refuse all requests for the use of any named file that starts with the characters.ht. It prohibits access to software choices for guests.\nYou can change the AccessFileName to specify another name where Apache can search for these configuration options. If you change this option, be sure to update the \u003cFiles\u003e directive to prevent unintentional public access.\nAny option that can be specified in a block of \u003cDirectory\u003e can be specified in a file.htaccess. .htaccess files are particularly useful in cases where the website operator is a user who has access to edit files in the public directory of the website, but not to any of the Apache configuration files.\nFor every request,.htaccess files are processed and refer to all requests made for files in the current directory. The directives also refer in the filesystem hierarchy to all folders “behind” the current directory.\nDespite the strength and versatility that.htaccess files offer, there are drawbacks to using them:\nIf files with .htaccess are allowed, Apache will need to check and process the directives in the .htaccess file on any request. In addition, Apache will search for.htaccess files in directories above the current file system directory. This can cause a minor degradation of performance if access files are allowed, and is true even if not used. Options set in files of .htaccess can override options set in blocks of \u003cDirectory\u003e which can cause confusion and unwanted actions. Any option set in a.htaccess file can be placed in a block under \u003cDirectory\u003e. Allowing non-privileged users to change configurations of web servers poses a potential security risk, but the AllowOverride options may greatly reduce this risk. If you wish to disable.htaccess files for a directory or directory tree, specify the option below in any directory block.\nAllowOverride None [ht_message mstyle=“alert” title=“NOTE” \" show_icon=“true” id=\"\" class=““style=”” ]For a directory that falls inside a directory where overrides have been disabled, you can define AllowOverride Everything.[/ht_message]"},"title":"Structure Of Apache Configuration"},"/docs/linux/update-dns-records-for-a-domain-using-plesk/":{"data":{"":"","#":"","1go-to-websites--domains-and-click-on-the-name-of-the-domain-you-want-to-manage-the-dns-settings-for#1.Go to Websites \u0026amp; Domains and click on the name of the domain you want to manage the DNS settings for.":"","2click-on-hostingdns-#2.Click on hosting\u0026amp;DNS .":"","3click-on-dns-settings#3.Click on DNS settings.":"","4after-clicking-add-record-you-will-be-brought-to-a-page-where-you-can-customise-the-dns-records-to-meet-your-needs#4.After clicking \u0026ldquo;add record,\u0026rdquo; you will be brought to a page where you can customise the DNS records to meet your needs.":"\nIntorduction The Domain name system, or DNS, is a naming framework that converts human-readable domain names into the numerical strings known as IP addresses that identify web sites.

It can fulfil three highly beneficial roles.\nDNS record DNS records, also known as zone files, are instructions that are stored in authoritative DNS servers. These instructions offer information about a domain, such as what IP address is connected with that domain and how to process requests for that domain. These entries are made up of a string of text files that are produced using DNS syntax. The DNS syntax is nothing more than a string of characters that functions as a set of instructions for the DNS server. Every DNS record also has something called a “TTL,” which stands for time-to-live and defines how frequently a DNS server will refresh that record. This value is included in all DNS records.\nA collection of DNS records can be compared to a listing for a company on Yelp.com. This directory will provide you with a lot of helpful information about a business, such as its location, hours of operation, and the services that it provides, among other things.

Although the features are identical, the key difference being that rewriting a URL requires the server returning a request other than the one received by the client, while redirecting simply returns a status code, and the client then asks for the “correct” answer.\nRewriting a request on a more realistic level does not affect the contents of the browser’s address bar, and can be useful in hiding URLs with sensitive or vulnerable data.\nEven though redirection helps you to quickly adjust the positions of different tools, in some cases you can find that rewriting suits your needs better. See Apache’s mod rewrite documentation for more detail.\nThankyou..","the-redirect-directive#The Redirect Directive":"You can find Redirect settings in your main Apache configuration file but we suggest that you keep them in your virtual host files or directory blocks. You can also use the Redirect statements in files with .htaccess. Here is an example of how Redirect could be used:\nRedirect /username http://team.abc.com/~username/ If no reason is provided, Redirect will submit a temporary (302) status code, and the client will be told that the /user name resource has temporarily moved to http:/team.abc.com/~user/.\nNo matter where they are located, Redirect statements must define the redirected resource’s complete file path, following the domain name. Such statements must provide even the full URL of the new location of the site.\nYou may also have a claim to return a HTTP status specific to:\nRedirect permanent /username http://team.abccom/~username/ Redirect temp /username http://team.abc.com/~username/ Redirect seeother /username http://team.abc.com/~username/ Redirect gone /username Permanent informs the customer the tool has permanently shifted. That returns a status code of 301 HTTP. Temp is the default action, which informs the client that the resource has temporarily relocated. This returns a 302 HTTP status code. Seeother informs the user that the requested tool was replaced with a different one. This returns a 303 HTTP status code. Gone informs the user that they have permanently removed the tool they are searching for. You don’t need to define a definite URL when using this statement. That returns a status code of 410 HTTP. The HTTP status codes can also be used as claims. Here is an example using the options with the status code:\nRedirect /username http://team.abc.com/~username/ Redirect /username http://team.abc.com/~username/ Redirect /username http://team.abc.com/~username/ Redirect /username RedirectPermanent and RedirectTemp can also execute permanent and temporary redirects, respectively:\nRedirectPermanent /username/bio.html http://team.abc.com/~username/bio/ RedirectTemp /username/bio.html http://team.abc.com/~username/bio/ Redirects can also be achieved using the regex patterns, using RedirectMatch:\nRedirectMatch (.\\*).jpg$ http://static.abc.com$1.jpg This match every request for a file with an extension of .jpg and replaces it with a position on a domain. The parentheses allow you to get a specific part of the request and insert it as a variable (specified by $1, $2, etc.) into the URL of the new site. For instance:\nA request is forwarded to http:/www.abc.com/avatar.jpg and to http:/static.abc.com/avatar.jpg Re-direct a submission for http:/www.abc.com/images/avatar.jpg to http:/static.abc.com/images/avatar.jpg.

Password expiration information can be viewed and updated with the chage command. This command is used when a user’s login is only going to be active for a short period of time, or if the user needs to have their password changed periodically. An account’s age, the time and date of its last password change, the time at which the account will be locked, and other similar details can all be viewed with the help of this command.\nThe help option can be used to see a complete list of the chage[change] command’s options.\n#chage -h If you want to see how old your accounts are (the -l option), you can do that. I’m using sudo to see the root’s age information. Enter :# sudo chage -l root\n#sudo chage -l root The second option, -d, allows you to change the last password to a date in the past that you specify in the command.

Type: sudo change -E root\n#chage -E 2022-10-10 root #chage -l root The -M or -m option lets you set the maximum and minimum intervals between password changes. I’m using the command sudo to update the root user’s age. Additionally, I am checking out the new time frame with the -l option. Key in: sudo change -M 5 root\n#chage -M 5 root #chage -l root The -I switch allows you to set the inactivity period for your account after it has expired. If the user doesn’t log in after the password has expired, this command will prompt them to change it. If the password isn’t changed after this time, the account will be locked and the user will need to contact the administrator to have it unlocked. I’m using the command sudo to update the root user’s age. Additionally, I viewed the idle time by using the -l option. Copy and paste: sudo change -I 5 root\n#chage -I 5 root #chage -l root Password expiration notices can be issued in advance with the help of the -W option. The command takes a number representing the number of days before the expiration date as its input. I’m using the command sudo to update the root user’s age. To see the caution period, I am using the -l option.

There is a real “need for speed.”\nYou will learn how to test the response time of a website using the command line in Linux by following the steps in this guide. In the following, we will demonstrate how to check the time required in seconds, specifically:\nfor the purpose of name resolution in order to establish a TCP connection to the server. for the process of transferring the file to start. for the first byte to be transferred during the process. for the entirety of the procedure. In addition, for HTTPS-enabled websites, we will also look at how to test the amount of time, in seconds, that it takes for a redirect as well as an SSL connection and handshake to be established with the server. It seems like a good idea, right? All right, then, let’s get started.\ncURL is a powerful command line tool that can transfer data from or to a server using a variety of different protocols, including FILE, FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, and many others. The majority of the time, it is employed either as an HTTP header checker or as a command line downloader. Nevertheless, we are going to talk about one of its less well-known functionalities here.\ncURL has a useful option: -w, which prints information on stdout after a successful operation. It contains some variables that can be used to test the various response times listed above for a website. We will make use of a few of the time-related variables, each of which may be passed in a specific format either as a literal string or contained within a file.\nNow, open up your computer’s terminal and type in the following command:\n#sudo apt install curl -y After the installation was complete, we are now able to test the loading time of a website that we require. Therefore, to test a website, the command is\n#curl -s -w 'Testing Website Response Time for :%{url_effective}nnLookup Time:tt%{time_namelookup}nConnect Time:tt%{time_connect}nPre-transfer Time:t%{time_pretransfer}nStart-transfer Time:t%{time_starttransfer}nnTotal Time:tt%{time_total}n' -o /dev/null ADDRESS In the preceding command, ADDRESS can either be the website’s URL or its IP address; either one is acceptable.\nWe used three options in the above command:\n-s: this will show an error if the command fails -w: this will make the curl display result of the command -o: output to a file *An HTTP website was put through its paces and the results are shown in the image below.\nLet’s say that in the event that we decide to test HTTPS websites, we want to include the following:\nThe total amount of time spent on the SSL connection (time appconnect) The time used to calculate redirection (time riderect) #curl -s -w 'Testing Website Response Time for :%{url_effective}nnLookup Time:tt%{time_namelookup}nConnect Time:tt%{time_connect}nAppCon Time:tt%{time_appconnect}nRedirect Time:tt%{time_redirect}nPre-transfer Time:t%{time_pretransfer}nStart-transfer Time:t%{time_starttransfer}nnTotal Time:tt%{time_total}n' -o /dev/null ADDRESS *So, if we don’t want to run such a long command, we can make it easier by putting it in a curl-formatted file and calling it from the command line.\nFrom this point on, we can observe how to make it. To begin, we need to input the command shown below in order to view the file using the vi text editor.\n#vi ~/curl-change.txt After that, copy the line and paste it into the file. After that, save the file and close it.\ntime_namelookup: %{time_namelookup}n time_connect: %{time_connect}n time_appconnect: %{time_appconnect}n time_pretransfer: %{time_pretransfer}n time_redirect: %{time_redirect}n time_starttransfer: %{time_starttransfer}n ----------n time_total: %{time_total}n Consequently, given that we have made the process simpler, we will need to carry out the command in the manner depicted in the following example.\n#curl -w \"@curl-change.txt\" -o /dev/null -s ADDRESS By utilising this command, we should be able to replace the ADDRESS with the URL or IP Address instead. This will work for websites that use either HTTP or HTTPS.\nWe will upload images by utilising the aforementioned script to run our website over HTTP and HTTPS.\nThe image below is a website that uses HTTP.

PostgreSQL is highly advantageous for enterprise-level applications that involve frequent write operations and intricate queries. Its robust features make it a top choice for handling large and complex databases. On the other hand, MySQL is more suitable for beginners due to its easier learning curve. It allows for quicker development of new database projects from scratch. Few reasons why more and more businesses are choosing PostgreSQL as their go-to database. PostgreSQL simplifies the process of setting up and utilizing databases, whether on-premises or in the cloud. In environments with a significant number of databases, both private and public, automating the creation of PostgreSQL instances can significantly save time.\nPostgreSQL is reliable: PostgreSQL implements a Write-Ahead Log mechanism to safeguard against system crashes. This ensures that any committed transactions, that have not yet been written to the database, can be recovered by replaying the Write-Ahead Log. As a result, these transactions are successfully committed without loss of data.\nPostgreSQL is extensible : PostgreSQL is like a customizable toolbox. Its extensibility means you can easily add new tools or features to tailor it to your specific needs. You can create custom data types, operators, and functions, and even plug in entire extensions, making it flexible and adaptable for different uses.\nPostgreSQL is fast: PostgreSQL is a performance-enhancing feature that includes enhanced partition handling, increased efficiency in parallel processing, faster indexing speeds, and the elimination of concurrency barriers. PostgreSQL is secure: PostgreSQL is widely recognized for its strong focus on data integrity and robust security features, including row-level security and advanced authentication mechanisms. This reputation positions it as a highly secure database system.\nWhat is MySQL and what is it used for? MySQL is a highly efficient, dependable, and easily expandable open-source relational database system. It is specially developed to manage demanding, critical production applications with heavy data loads. As it is managed by a robust RDMS, MySQL is a widely used and user-friendly database that requires minimal resources in terms of memory, disk space, and CPU usage.\nMySQL is widely compatible: Despite its frequent association with internet applications and web services, MySQL was purposefully designed to have broad compatibility with a range of technologies and architectures. It is supported on all major computing platforms, including Unix-based systems like various Linux distributions and Mac OS, as well as Windows.\nMySQL databases are relational: Databases such as MySQL store data in various tables that are highly structured and separated, rather than relying on a single comprehensive repository or collections of unstructured documents. This design enables RDBMSs to efficiently optimize processes such as data retrieval, information updates, and more advanced actions such as aggregations.\nMySQL is open-source: These options offer organizations a higher degree of flexibility when considering utilizing MySQL. The open-source nature of the releases, which are publicly and community-driven, enhances MySQL’s documentation and online support culture, while also guaranteeing that any new or ongoing developments remain in line with current user demands.\nWhich is better MySQL or PostgreSQL?\nAlthough MySQL and PostgreSQL possess several similarities, the variances between them are substantial and may cause confusion for both novice and expert database managers. It is evident that MySQL has effectively enhanced itself to remain pertinent, while PostgreSQL stands out for its lack of licensing requirements and additional features such as table inheritance, rules systems, custom data types, and database events. As a result, PostgreSQL takes the lead over MySQL in this regard.\nHow can Utho support your PostgreSQL and MySQL requirements?

Recognized as a commonly utilized programming language, Bash supports a range of functions, variables, loops, and conditional statements, resembling features found in several other programming languages. Users can leverage Bash to interpret commands and execute multiple actions.\nHow does Bash function? From a technical standpoint, Bash serves as a command interpreter, processing and executing basic system commands like ls or mkdir. This interaction is the primary way of working with Bash. Additionally, there’s a second method involving batch files, containing Bash code. Mastering Bash scripting, which involves writing and executing batch files, provides a significant advantage, allowing automation of tasks and the creation of complex system commands.\n**What are the features of Bash? **\n**Here are fundamental concepts in Bash that every user should acquaint themselves with:\nCommands:** A command serves as an instruction directing the shell’s actions, and it can range from simple to complex, entered into the terminal through typing.\nArguments: Arguments consist of supplementary information provided to a command to alter its behavior, encompassing options, filenames, or other types of data.\nVariables: Variables serve as storage for data utilized by the shell or scripts, capable of being assigned values and employed within commands or scripts.\nFunctions: Functions are employed to group commands together, enabling the execution of specific tasks. They can be invoked either from the command line or within a Bash script.\nRedirection: Redirection is the process of directing a command’s output to a file or another command. This functionality enables users to save the output to a file or utilize it as input for another command in the command prompt.\nWildcards: Wildcards serve the purpose of matching patterns in filenames or other data, allowing the selection of multiple files or the execution of operations on groups of files.\n**What are the advantages of using Bash? **\nThe introduction of windows and menus was a significant advancement in computer software development, so why revert to using CLIs like Bash? CLI usage persists due to several distinct advantages over GUIs. Let’s delve into some of these advantages.\nEnhance your operating system access efficiency: Individuals opt for Bash when they seek to manage their computer or OS without navigating through GUI menus, options, and windows. Additionally, using Bash instead of a GUI is more resource-efficient, as it eliminates the need for the computer to allocate resources to render graphical output. This makes Bash an appealing choice when running multiple programs, a virtual machine, or working with limited computing resources.\n**\nInput and output with text files:** Bash simplifies the creation and editing of text files, including CSVs. Given that text files are among the most prevalent means of storing and processing data, Bash proves to be excellent for tasks such as organizing and refining data, sorting and filtering data, scrubbing and refreshing data.\nAutomate with ease: Bash facilitates the automation of tasks on your computer, particularly beneficial when your job entails repetitive functions.\nWhat are the primary use cases of Bash? Key Applications of Bash:\nScripting: Bash scripting empowers users to create scripts, sequences of commands, enabling the automation of repetitive tasks, system administration, and the development of intricate workflows.\n**\nFile and Directory Management:** Bash simplifies file and directory operations, encompassing tasks such as creating, deleting, copying, moving, and renaming files and directories.\nRemote Server Management: Bash is commonly employed to establish secure connections to remote servers through SSH (Secure Shell) and execute operations on distant systems.\nSoftware Development: Bash scripts find application in software development workflows, handling tasks such as build automation, deployment, and testing.\nWhat are the primary use cases of CMD? System Information: CMD provides commands like systeminfo to retrieve detailed information about the system, including hardware and software configurations.\nNetwork Troubleshooting: Commands like ipconfig, ping, and tracert help diagnose and troubleshoot network-related issues.\nTask Management: CMD provides commands like tasklist and taskkill to view and manage running processes and applications.\nRemote Access: CMD supports remote access and management of other systems using commands like psexec and ssh.\nWhat is CMD (Command Prompt)? CMD (Command Prompt) serves as a command-line interpreter on Windows operating systems, offering a text-based interface for executing diverse system and application commands, as well as facilitating scripting and automation tasks. It is commonly known as the “Windows command prompt” or simply the “command prompt.”\nWhat is the functioning mechanism of Command Prompt? The command-line interface (CLI) accepts text commands entered through a keyboard. Although CLIs may have varying syntaxes, they generally carry out similar operations. Upon command execution, the computer interprets and performs the specified actions, while the CLI offers user feedback, including error messages or output from the executed commands.\nWhat are the advantages of utilizing a Command Prompt? Using a command-line interface (CLI) offers numerous advantages, with the most notable being:\nSpeed: The CLI allows for swift execution of commands, enabling the combination of multiple commands into a single line of text for program execution. This efficiency surpasses the navigation through menus in a GUI.\nResources: The CLI demands fewer computing resources for executing commands compared to a graphical interface.\nRepetitive Tasks: The CLI proves effective in automating repetitive tasks, allowing the creation of batch files to automate tasks at any specified time.\nPower-user: A CLI is well-suited for power users as it grants access to commands not available in a GUI. For instance, certain system-protected tasks cannot be accessed through a GUI.","what-are-the-features-of-bash#**What are the features of Bash?":"","what-are-the-primary-use-cases-of-bash#\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the primary use cases of Bash?\u003c/strong\u003e":"","what-are-the-primary-use-cases-of-cmd#\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the primary use cases of CMD?\u003c/strong\u003e":"","what-is-bash#\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Bash?\u003c/strong\u003e":"","what-is-cmd-command-prompt#\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is CMD (Command Prompt)?\u003c/strong\u003e":"","what-is-the-functioning-mechanism-of-command-prompt#\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the functioning mechanism of Command Prompt?\u003c/strong\u003e":""},"title":"Bash vs. CMD: Decoding the Battle of Command Line Titans"},"/docs/plesk/basics-information-of-apache-configuration/":{"data":{"":"\nThe Apache HTTP web server is the de facto standard for general HTTP services in many respects. Thanks to its large number of modules, it offers versatile support for proxy servers, URL rewriting, and granular access control. In addition, web developers also prefer Apache to support server-side scripting using CGI, FastCGI, and embedded interpreters. Such features make it easier to execute complex code quickly and efficiently. Although there are many popular alternatives to Apache, also within the bounds of open source, the scope of Apache use is remarkable.\nApache does not without any expense the exceptional degree of flexibility; this takes on the form of a configuration system that is often confusing and sometimes complicated. We have therefore developed this document and a number of other guides to tackle this issue and explore some more advanced and optional Apache HTTP Sever features.\nIf you would like to have a working web server and install Apache for the first time, we suggest using the corresponding “Apache development guide” for your Linux distribution. Try trying a suitable LAMP guide for your delivery, if you need a more full LAMP stack. This guide assumes that you have an up to date Linux setup, installed Apache successfully, and logged into a root access shell session.","apache-basics#Apache Basics":"The default Apache settings vary widely between different Linux distributions. All distributions from Debian, Ubuntu, and Gentoo refer to Apache as “Apache2” and bring configuration files into the directory /etc/apache2/. Certain distributions such as Fedora, CentOS and Arch Linux refer to Apache as “httpd,” and store /etc/httpd/ configuration files. While we allow you to learn about the default configuration of your Apache server, most configurational choices do not differ between the operating systems. The main obstacles to Apache’s setup are to grasp the regular configurations of the implementations and their variations from the upstream Apache.\nYou may use the “init” scripts to manage basic Apache features to safely and quickly start, stop or restart the server. The init script can also reload the configuration and check the server status. Edit the correct command to access these functions:\n/etc/init.d/apache2 start /etc/init.d/apache2 stop /etc/init.d/apache2 restart /etc/init.d/apache2 reload /etc/init.d/apache2 status If you use a distribution referred to as httpd by Apache, the commands are as follows:\n/etc/init.d/httpd start /etc/init.d/httpd stop /etc/init.d/httpd restart /etc/init.d/httpd reload /etc/init.d/httpd status The path to the script may be /etc/rc.d/init.d/ for some versions instead of /etc/init.d/.\nIn the init script with the command mod_disk_cache on Debian-based distributions contain the functions to monitor the htcache functionality:\n/etc/init.d/apache2 start-htcacheclean /etc/init.d/apache2 stop-htcacheclean Further functions from the command line interface are also supported. You can use the following command in Debian and Ubuntu systems to test the syntax of your Apache configuration files without restarting the server and trying it:\napache2ctl -t In CentOS and Fedora systems, use the following form:\nhttpd -t Furthermore, the apache2ctl -S or httpd -S Commands provide an update on virtual machines that currently run, which include the port the host listens on, the virtual host’s name (i.e. the domain) and site configuration information including file names and line numbers.\nThe “master” file for Apache is usually located in the httpd.conf. This file is in the apache2.conf file in Debian distributions, with a user-specific configuration in the httpd.conf file, including the master file, the master file contains some other files. To receive a list of the following items, submit an order according to your distribution:\ngrep \"Include\" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf grep \"Include\" /etc/apache2/httpd.conf grep \"Include\" /etc/httpd/httpd.conf Note that the order of these files can affect the web server behavior. When later options contradict options set in previous files, then earlier options are overridden. Knowing the current default configuration can be a valuable learning experience.","configuration-file-organization#Configuration File Organization":"One of the most common use cases for the Apache web server is to use its “virtual hosting” capabilities, which allow a single instance of Apache to serve numerous websites and subdomains. Because most websites don’t tend to use a significant amount of system resources, virtual hosting is often a great way to fully utilize a web server. As a result of this capability, configuration files for virtual hosts can be complex and difficult to organize. There are two major approaches to the solution for this problem.","create-a-single-virtual-hosts-file#Create a Single Virtual Hosts file":"For each virtual host, the Debian method of maintaining a single configuration file can be useful in managing many noninterlinked sites or for the editing of various distinct and unprivileged users. However, there are circumstances in which too many virtual host files may cause confusion and increase the maintenance burden by setting the same configuration group for a collection of hosts.\nFor these instances, the easiest way to keep Apache installed would be to provide a single file. This is the chosen host organization in some distributions, such as CentOS, Fedora, and Arch Linux. When checking Apache’s default distribution configuration, there’s normally a conf.d/directory where you can store user-created configuration. When you want to merge multiple virtual host configuration files into one file, create a vhosts.conf in the conf.d/ folder and add the entire configuration options in that file. Theconf.d/folder is located within the /etc/ directory of Apache, either: /etc/apache2/conf.d/or, where your distribution is concerned, /etc/httpd/conf.d/ .\nBoth settings are essentially similar, but can be implemented conveniently in different scenarios. The structure of the configuration file you choose depends on the specifications of your particular application.","symbolic-links-and-the-debian-way#Symbolic Links and the Debian Way":"To order to enhance usability, the Debian project enables users to effectively prevent changing the web server’s “foundation configuration.” As a result, Debian and Ubuntu use symbolic links to allow and disable various configuration options for administrators without fully erasing configuration options.\nMake sure that your apache.conf or httpd.conf file has the correct line if you are using an operating system other than Debian or choose to use the sites-enabled organization to customize your settings.\nInclude /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/ Include /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ You need to use a command like: mkdir -p /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/. if you haven’t created this directory yet. Now the setup options for any files that you store in those directories will be included on your Apache server. Please use the following command to create a connection to this directory:\nln -s /etc/httpd/vhosts/abc.com /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/abc.com The syntax for creating symbolic links is ln -s followed by the original or “goal” file and the path to the link to be connected. If you skip the final word, ln will build a connection in the current directory with the same name as the target file. The original file will not be affected if you delete a connection. Apache can follow multiple layers of symbolic connections, but this can be confusing for itself.\nOne advantage of this is that a virtual host can keep its configuration files close to the other associated host files. All your virtual host-related services are mostly located in a /srv/www/abc.com/ directory. Under the DocumentRoot, directory, logs directory and application support directories, public_html/,logs/and application/ are stored. This organization helps you to find it convent to store your configuration file with your virtual host in /srv/www/abc.com/. This makes it easy to back up and transfer a virtual host, since all files are in one directory. The symbolic connection can be generated as following if the virtual host set up file is located at /srv/www/abc.com/apache.conf you might create the symbolic link as follows:\nln -s /srv/www/abc.com/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/abc.com You can use the a2ensite and a2dissite software to handle virtual host files if you are using a Debian distribution. You can also use/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/abc.com to manually connect your configuration files. When you do not use a Debian distribution, the symbolic relation may look the same, but file names and locations can change somewhat:\nln -s /srv/www/abc.com/apache.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/abc.conf "},"title":"Basics Information of Apache Configuration"},"/docs/plesk/how-to-add-a-record-in-plesk/":{"data":{"":"","conclusion#Conclusion":"Hopefully, now you have learned how to add A record in Plesk.\nAlso read: How to add MX record in Plesk.\nThank You 🙂","introduction#Introduction":"In this article, you will learn how to add A record in Plesk.\nThis is the most basic form of DNS record, and it is denoted by the letter “A,” which stands for the word “address.” It provides the IP address of a certain domain.\nStep 1.

It’s widely utilized for managing microservice architectures and can be deployed across various cloud providers.\nKubernetes empowers application developers, IT system administrators, and DevOps engineers to automate the deployment, scaling, maintenance, scheduling, and operation of multiple application containers across node clusters. While containers share a common operating system (OS) on host machines, they remain isolated from each other by default, unless explicitly connected by a user.\nWhy you need Kubernetes and what it can do Containers offer a convenient way to package and execute applications. However, in a production setup, managing these containers and ensuring continuous operation is crucial. For instance, when a container crashes, another should swiftly take its place. Wouldn’t it be convenient if this process were automated?\nEnter Kubernetes! Kubernetes offers a robust framework for running distributed systems with resilience. It handles tasks like scaling, failover management, and deploying patterns for your applications. For instance, Kubernetes effortlessly orchestrates canary deployments, enabling seamless updates for your system.\nKubernetes offer several benefits: Service Discovery and Load Balancing: Easily expose containers using DNS names or IP addresses, and Kubernetes efficiently distributes network traffic to maintain deployment stability.\nStorage Orchestration: Automatically mount storage systems of your choice, including local storage and various public cloud providers.\nAutomated Rollouts and Rollbacks: Describe your container’s desired state, and Kubernetes smoothly transitions it to the specified state at a controlled pace. This includes creating new containers, removing existing ones, and transferring resources seamlessly.\nAutomatic Bin Packing: Specify CPU and memory requirements for containers, and Kubernetes optimizes resource usage by efficiently allocating containers to nodes within your cluster.\nSelf-Healing: Kubernetes ensures the reliability of your containers by automatically restarting or replacing failed containers and handling unresponsive ones, ensuring they’re ready to serve before being advertised to clients.\nSecret and Configuration Management: Securely store and manage sensitive information like passwords and tokens, deploy and update secrets and configurations without rebuilding container images, and maintain confidentiality in your stack configuration.\nBatch Execution: Kubernetes effectively manages batch and CI workloads, replacing failed containers as needed.\nHorizontal Scaling: Easily scale your application up or down using simple commands, a user-friendly interface, or automatic scaling based on CPU usage.\nIPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack: Allocate both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services, ensuring compatibility across different network protocols.\nExtensibility: Extend the capabilities of your Kubernetes cluster by adding features without the need to modify the upstream source code.\nHow Kubernetes works Kubernetes simplifies managing a cluster of computing instances by handling container deployment and scaling. Containers are organized into logical groups called pods, allowing you to run and scale one or multiple containers together. The Kubernetes control plane software takes care of crucial tasks like determining when and where to deploy your pods, managing traffic routing, and adjusting pod scaling based on resource utilization or other metrics you specify. It automatically initiates pods on your cluster according to their resource needs and restarts them if either the pods or the instances they run on encounter failures. Each pod receives its own IP address and a unique DNS name, which Kubernetes utilizes for connecting your services internally and routing external traffic. This streamlined approach ensures seamless communication and management within your Kubernetes environment.\nKubernetes Advantages The Kubernetes platform offers several key advantages that have contributed to its widespread adoption:\nPortability: Containers are easily transportable across various environments, from virtual setups to bare metal. Since Kubernetes is supported on major public clouds, you can run containerized applications on Kubernetes in diverse environments.\nIntegration and Extensibility: Kubernetes seamlessly integrates with existing solutions such as logging, monitoring, and alerting services. Additionally, the Kubernetes community actively develops open-source solutions that complement Kubernetes, resulting in a robust and rapidly expanding ecosystem.\nCost Efficiency: Kubernetes optimizes resource usage, automates scaling, and provides flexibility to run workloads where they’re most beneficial, giving you control over your IT spending. Scalability: Cloud-native applications scale horizontally, and Kubernetes employs auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically spin up additional container instances and scale out in response to demand.\nAPI-Based: Kubernetes operates on a REST API foundation, enabling comprehensive control over the Kubernetes environment through programming.\nSimplified CI/CD: Kubernetes facilitates Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, automating the building, testing, and deployment of applications to production environments. Enterprises are integrating Kubernetes with CI/CD to establish scalable pipelines that dynamically adapt to workload demands.\nCommon Kubernetes terms Here are some key Kubernetes terms that can help you understand how Kubernetes operates:\nCluster: The core of the Kubernetes engine, where containerized applications run. It consists of a group of machines that manage and execute applications.\nNode: Worker machines within a cluster that execute tasks.\nPod: Collections of containers deployed together on the same host machine to perform related tasks.\nReplication Controller: An abstraction used to manage the lifecycle of pods, ensuring a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.\nSelector: A system used to find and categorize specific resources based on predefined criteria.\nLabel: Key-value pairs assigned to resources for filtering, organizing, and performing operations on resource sets.\nAnnotation: Similar to labels but with a larger data capacity, annotations provide additional information about resources.\nIngress: An API object that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically for HTTP traffic. It facilitates name-based virtual hosting, load balancing, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) termination.\nTHE END","kubernetes#Kubernetes":""},"title":"index"},"/docs/products/loadbalancer/":{"data":{"#":"","loadbalancer#LoadBalancer":"","steps-for-approaching-the-loadbalancer#Steps for approaching the LoadBalancer:":"LoadBalancer Load balancing means spreading out incoming network traffic across a bunch of backend servers or resources.\nLoad Balancer works at layer 4 of the OSI model. Think of it as the middleman between clients and servers. When traffic comes in, the load balancer sends it to different backend servers based on rules you set up, like how healthy each server is. These backend servers could be Utho Virtual Machines or part of a Virtual Machine Scale Set.\nWhy use Load Balancer? With Load Balancer, you can easily scale your applications and ensure they stay available. It supports both inbound and outbound traffic scenarios, offering fast response times and high data transfer rates. Plus, it can handle millions of connections for all TCP and UDP applications.\nHere are some key things you can do with Load Balancer:\nBalance both internal and external traffic to Utho virtual machines. Improve reliability by spreading resources across different zones. Set up outbound connections for virtual machines. Monitor the health of your balanced resources using health probes. Access virtual machines in your network through public IP addresses and ports using port forwarding. Support IPv6 for load balancing. Balance services across multiple ports, IP addresses or both. Types of Load Balancers – Based on Functions Various load-balancing techniques exist to tackle specific network issues.\nNetwork Load Balancer (Layer 4 - L4):\nNetwork Load Balancers distribute traffic based on network variables like IP addresses and destination ports. They operate at the transport layer (TCP - level 4), making routing decisions without considering application-level parameters such as content type, cookies, or headers. These balancers focus solely on network layer information to direct traffic.\nApplication Load Balancer (Layer 7 - L7):\nApplication Load Balancers, at the highest level of the OSI model, distribute requests based on various application-level parameters. They analyze a broader range of data, including HTTP headers and SSL sessions, to distribute server load based on multiple variables. This enables them to manage server traffic based on individual usage and behavior.\nGlobal Server Load Balancer (Multi-site Load Balancer)\nGlobal Server Load Balancers (GSLBs) extend the capabilities of L4 and L7 load balancers across multiple data centers, especially in cloud environments. They efficiently distribute load globally, ensuring optimal performance for end users across different geographical locations. Additionally, they facilitate quick recovery and seamless business operations in case of server disasters by redirecting traffic to alternative data centers. Understanding Load Balancing Algorithms\nLoad balancing algorithms consist of rules guiding a load balancer in selecting the optimal server for various client requests. These algorithms are broadly categorized into two main types.\nDynamic Load Balancing Algorithms Explained:\nLeast Connection\nRoutes traffic to servers with the fewest open connections, assuming similar processing power for all connections.\nWeighted Least Connection\nAllows assigning different weights to servers, accommodating varying connection-handling capacities.\nWeighted Response Time\nConsiders both server response time and active connections to direct traffic to servers with the quickest responses, ensuring faster service.\nResource-Based\nDistributes load based on available server resources like CPU and memory. A specialized software agent on each server measures resource availability, guiding the load balancer in traffic distribution.\nStatic load balancing Algorithms Explained:\nStatic Load Balancing Algorithms Explained:\nRound Robin:\nDistributes traffic to servers in rotation using the Domain Name System (DNS). Each DNS query receives a different server address. Weighted Round Robin:\nLets administrators assign different weights to servers, allocating more traffic to those with higher capacity. Weighting is configurable within DNS records.

Here on click on L.H.S bar we will get two options to navigate to Target Group as shown below. Now for creating the target group click on the marked point given on the snippet. After clicking on that button a side bar will open where the user have to fill all the details related to Target Group. NAME: This is a user-defined name for the target group, which helps identify it within your system. It’s usually a descriptive label to indicate the purpose or function of the target group. PROTOCOL: This specifies the communication protocol used for routing traffic to the targets in the target group. Common protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL. PORT: This is the port number on which the targets in the target group are listening for incoming traffic. For example, if your application runs on port 80 for HTTP traffic, you would specify port 80 here. HEALTH CHECK PATH: This is the URL path that the load balancer periodically checks on each target to determine its health status. It’s typically a specific endpoint on your application server that returns a health check response (e.g., “/health” or “/status”). HEALTH CHECK PROTOCOL: This specifies the protocol used for health checks. It’s often the same as the protocol used for routing traffic to the targets (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), but it can be different if necessary. Health Check Interval: This is the time interval at which the load balancer sends health check requests to the targets to verify their health status. It’s usually specified in seconds. Health Check Timeout: This is the maximum amount of time the load balancer waits for a response from a target before considering the health check failed. It’s specified in seconds. Healthy Threshold: This is the number of consecutive successful health checks required for a target to be considered healthy. Once a target reaches this threshold, it’s considered healthy and can receive traffic. Unhealthy Threshold: This is the number of consecutive failed health checks required for a target to be considered unhealthy. Once a target reaches this threshold, it’s considered unhealthy and is removed from the pool of available targets until it becomes healthy again.

It is possible to drag and drop more than one file at once into the Upload Files Panel.\nAccess Control \u0026 Permission Sharing access to objects and buckets with other Utho Object Storage users is possible. To configure sharing, two methods are available: bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs). Both of these technologies have similar purposes in that they can be used to provide and restrict access to resources stored in Object Storage. Although ACLs do not provide as many fine-grained access modes as bucket policies, they can still be used to restrict or give access to specific items.\nUsing bucket policies is highly recommended if you can group items with comparable permission requirements into separate buckets. If you are unable to arrange your items in this way, ACLs remain a useful choice.\nComparing ACLs to bucket policies, you can manage permissions more precisely using bucket policies. Select bucket policies over ACLs if you need more granular permissions than just read and write access.\nApplying a written bucket policy file to the bucket is another way to construct bucket policies. This file can’t be larger than 20 KB. You might wish to use ACLs instead if your policy has a long list of policy rules.\nBucket policies and ACLs can be utilised simultaneously. Any rule that restricts access to an Object Storage resource takes precedence over a rule that authorises access in this scenario. For example, if a bucket policy prohibits a user from accessing a bucket that an ACL permits, the user will not be able to access the bucket."},"title":"Utho Object Storage - Get Started"},"/docs/products/vpc/":{"data":{"#":"VPC A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service provided by public cloud providers, enabling enterprises to create their own private cloud-like computing environment within shared public cloud infrastructure.\nWhy Choose a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?

This encryption is key in securely transmitting sensitive data, preventing unauthorized individuals from intercepting the traffic. Moreover, a VPN enables users to work remotely, providing a secure means of conducting tasks from a distance. Notably, VPN technology finds extensive usage within corporate environments.\nWhy Consider Using a VPN? When your browser connects to a web server, it first checks with Domain Name Services (DNS) servers to find the server’s IP address. While most connections are encrypted using SSL/TLS, there are still vulnerabilities, especially on public Wi-Fi networks. For example, a skilled attacker could weaken the encryption protocol, making communications vulnerable to brute-force attacks.\nUsing a VPN adds an extra layer of security to the connection. The VPN service encrypts data and sends it across the network. As a result, the targeted server sees the VPN’s public IP address instead of the user’s. If there’s a hijacked connection and someone tries to eavesdrop, strong VPN encryption prevents potential brute-force attacks, protecting data from exposure in an insecure environment.\nWhat does a VPN (virtual private network) do? Instead of connecting directly to the internet, your web traffic is routed through a VPN server. This process conceals your IP address, making it appear as though your web activity originates from your VPN service provider’s network rather than your actual location. This additional layer of protection between your device, whether it’s a computer or smartphone, allows you to browse and use the internet securely and with enhanced privacy.\nAdvantages of Using a VPN: VPNs offer users and organizations several benefits, including:\nSecure Connectivity: VPNs encrypt connections, ensuring that third parties cannot intercept data without the encryption keys. Streamlined Distributed Networks: Site-to-site VPNs create a virtual link between networks, allowing them to use private IP addresses for internal traffic, simplifying network management. Access Control: VPNs enable remote users to access internal resources securely, as the VPN endpoint is within the network firewall, allowing authorized access without exposing resources to the public.

Thanks to its large number of modules, it offers versatile support for proxy servers, URL rewriting, and granular access control. In addition, web developers also prefer Apache to support server-side scripting using CGI, FastCGI, and embedded interpreters. Such features make it easier to execute complex code quickly and efficiently. Although there are many popular alternatives to Apache, also within the bounds of open source, the scope of Apache use is remarkable.\nApache does not without any expense the exceptional degree of flexibility; this takes on the form of a configuration system that is often confusing and sometimes complicated. We have therefore developed this document and a number of other guides to tackle this issue and explore some more advanced and optional Apache HTTP Sever features.\nIf you would like to have a working web server and install Apache for the first time, we suggest using the corresponding “Apache development guide” for your Linux distribution. Try trying a suitable LAMP guide for your delivery, if you need a more full LAMP stack. This guide assumes that you have an up to date Linux setup, installed Apache successfully, and logged into a root access shell session.","apache-basics#Apache Basics":"The default Apache settings vary widely between different Linux distributions. All distributions from Debian, Ubuntu, and Gentoo refer to Apache as “Apache2” and bring configuration files into the directory /etc/apache2/. Certain distributions such as Fedora, CentOS and Arch Linux refer to Apache as “httpd,” and store /etc/httpd/ configuration files. While we allow you to learn about the default configuration of your Apache server, most configurational choices do not differ between the operating systems. The main obstacles to Apache’s setup are to grasp the regular configurations of the implementations and their variations from the upstream Apache.\nYou may use the “init” scripts to manage basic Apache features to safely and quickly start, stop or restart the server. The init script can also reload the configuration and check the server status. Edit the correct command to access these functions:\n/etc/init.d/apache2 start /etc/init.d/apache2 stop /etc/init.d/apache2 restart /etc/init.d/apache2 reload /etc/init.d/apache2 status If you use a distribution referred to as httpd by Apache, the commands are as follows:\n/etc/init.d/httpd start /etc/init.d/httpd stop /etc/init.d/httpd restart /etc/init.d/httpd reload /etc/init.d/httpd status The path to the script may be /etc/rc.d/init.d/ for some versions instead of /etc/init.d/.\nIn the init script with the command mod_disk_cache on Debian-based distributions contain the functions to monitor the htcache functionality:\n/etc/init.d/apache2 start-htcacheclean /etc/init.d/apache2 stop-htcacheclean Further functions from the command line interface are also supported. You can use the following command in Debian and Ubuntu systems to test the syntax of your Apache configuration files without restarting the server and trying it:\napache2ctl -t In CentOS and Fedora systems, use the following form:\nhttpd -t Furthermore, the apache2ctl -S or httpd -S Commands provide an update on virtual machines that currently run, which include the port the host listens on, the virtual host’s name (i.e. the domain) and site configuration information including file names and line numbers.\nThe “master” file for Apache is usually located in the httpd.conf. This file is in the apache2.conf file in Debian distributions, with a user-specific configuration in the httpd.conf file, including the master file, the master file contains some other files. To receive a list of the following items, submit an order according to your distribution:\ngrep \"Include\" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf grep \"Include\" /etc/apache2/httpd.conf grep \"Include\" /etc/httpd/httpd.conf Note that the order of these files can affect the web server behavior. When later options contradict options set in previous files, then earlier options are overridden. Knowing the current default configuration can be a valuable learning experience.","configuration-file-organization#Configuration File Organization":"One of the most common use cases for the Apache web server is to use its “virtual hosting” capabilities, which allow a single instance of Apache to serve numerous websites and subdomains. Because most websites don’t tend to use a significant amount of system resources, virtual hosting is often a great way to fully utilize a web server. As a result of this capability, configuration files for virtual hosts can be complex and difficult to organize. There are two major approaches to the solution for this problem.","create-a-single-virtual-hosts-file#Create a Single Virtual Hosts file":"For each virtual host, the Debian method of maintaining a single configuration file can be useful in managing many noninterlinked sites or for the editing of various distinct and unprivileged users. However, there are circumstances in which too many virtual host files may cause confusion and increase the maintenance burden by setting the same configuration group for a collection of hosts.\nFor these instances, the easiest way to keep Apache installed would be to provide a single file. This is the chosen host organization in some distributions, such as CentOS, Fedora, and Arch Linux. When checking Apache’s default distribution configuration, there’s normally a conf.d/directory where you can store user-created configuration. When you want to merge multiple virtual host configuration files into one file, create a vhosts.conf in the conf.d/ folder and add the entire configuration options in that file. Theconf.d/folder is located within the /etc/ directory of Apache, either: /etc/apache2/conf.d/or, where your distribution is concerned, /etc/httpd/conf.d/ .\nBoth settings are essentially similar, but can be implemented conveniently in different scenarios. The structure of the configuration file you choose depends on the specifications of your particular application.","symbolic-links-and-the-debian-way#Symbolic Links and the Debian Way":"To order to enhance usability, the Debian project enables users to effectively prevent changing the web server’s “foundation configuration.” As a result, Debian and Ubuntu use symbolic links to allow and disable various configuration options for administrators without fully erasing configuration options.\nMake sure that your apache.conf or httpd.conf file has the correct line if you are using an operating system other than Debian or choose to use the sites-enabled organization to customize your settings.\nInclude /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/ Include /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ You need to use a command like: mkdir -p /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/. if you haven’t created this directory yet. Now the setup options for any files that you store in those directories will be included on your Apache server. Please use the following command to create a connection to this directory:\nln -s /etc/httpd/vhosts/abc.com /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/abc.com The syntax for creating symbolic links is ln -s followed by the original or “goal” file and the path to the link to be connected. If you skip the final word, ln will build a connection in the current directory with the same name as the target file. The original file will not be affected if you delete a connection. Apache can follow multiple layers of symbolic connections, but this can be confusing for itself.\nOne advantage of this is that a virtual host can keep its configuration files close to the other associated host files. All your virtual host-related services are mostly located in a /srv/www/abc.com/ directory. Under the DocumentRoot, directory, logs directory and application support directories, public_html/,logs/and application/ are stored. This organization helps you to find it convent to store your configuration file with your virtual host in /srv/www/abc.com/. This makes it easy to back up and transfer a virtual host, since all files are in one directory. The symbolic connection can be generated as following if the virtual host set up file is located at /srv/www/abc.com/apache.conf you might create the symbolic link as follows:\nln -s /srv/www/abc.com/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/abc.com You can use the a2ensite and a2dissite software to handle virtual host files if you are using a Debian distribution. You can also use/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/abc.com to manually connect your configuration files. When you do not use a Debian distribution, the symbolic relation may look the same, but file names and locations can change somewhat:\nln -s /srv/www/abc.com/apache.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/abc.conf "},"title":"Basics Information of Apache Configuration"},"/docs/web-servers/how-to-configure-modsecurity-in-apache/":{"data":{"":"","centos#CentOS":"","debian#Debian":"","default-debian-dir-for-modsecuritys-persistent-data-secdatadir-varcachemodsecurity#Default Debian dir for modsecurity\u0026rsquo;s persistent data SecDataDir /var/cache/modsecurity":"Introduction ModSecurity is a web firewall application for an Apache web server.

If you already have a website and want to change your domain, you shouldn’t just give up on your old domain. If the content on your site disappears without telling the browser where it is now, bookmarks and links to your site from other pages on the internet will stop working. If you change domains without redirecting, you’ll lose traffic from people who used to visit your site and all the credibility you’ve worked hard to build.\nOften, it’s a good idea to register multiple versions of a name so that people who type in addresses that look like your main domain can find you. For example, if you have a domain called myspiders.com, you could also buy the domain names for myspiders.net and myspiders.org and point them both to your myspiders.com site. This lets you catch people who might be typing in the wrong address to get to your site. It can also stop another site from using a similar domain name and making money off of your online presence.\nSometimes, you need to change the names of pages on your site that have already been published and gotten traffic. In most cases, this would lead to a 404 Not Found error or, depending on your security settings, another error. You can avoid these by sending your visitors to a different page that has the right information they were looking for. There are a few different kinds of URL redirects, and each one tells the client browser something different. 302 temporary redirects and 301 permanent redirects are the most common.\nTemporary Redirects Temporary redirects are useful if you need to serve the web content for a certain URL from a different place for a short time. For example, if you are doing maintenance on your site, you may need to use a temporary redirect to send all of your domain’s pages to a page explaining that you will be back soon.\nTemporary redirects tell the browser that the content is temporarily at a different location, but that the original URL should still be tried.\nPermanent Redirects Permanent redirects are useful when your content has been moved to a new location forever.\nThis is useful for when you need to change domains or when the URL needs to change for other reasons and the old location will no longer be used. This redirect informs the browser that it should no longer request the old URL and should update its information to point to the new URL\nForcing SSL One common way to use redirects is to tell all traffic to a site to use SSL instead of HTTP.\nYou can make all requests for http://www.example.com go to https://www.example.com by using redirects.\nHow to Redirect in Nginx Redirects are an important part of Nginx and use directives that are often used. Most of the time, redirects can be set up by making a new server block for every URL.\nNginx server blocks can be saved in the main Nginx settings file in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, but it’s easier to keep track of them if you make a new file for each configuration in /etc/nginx/sites-available/. As you turn files on or off, Nginx creates symbolic links, which are like short-cuts, from files in sites-available/ to another folder called sites-available/. By default, Nginx is installed with a single site-specific configuration in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default that is enabled and linked to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.\nvi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default By default, it contains a standard web server configuration that will listen on port 80 and look for an index.html file located in /var/www/html on your system.\nIf you instead needed to redirect requests for example1.com to example2.com you could remove the existing directives from this server block and replace them with a permanent redirect:\nvi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default server { listen 80; server_name example1.com; return 301 $scheme://example2.com$request_uri; } The return directive runs a URL substitution and then sends back the redirection URL and the status code that was given to it.\nIn this case, it uses the $scheme variable to use whichever scheme was used in the original request (http or https). Then it gives back the 301 permanent redirect code and the new URL.\nUsing the rewrite directive, you can do something similar to the Apache folder redirection to send a folder to a different subdomain. When this directive is put in a server block, requests inside the images directory will be temporarily sent to the subdomain images.example.com:\n/etc/nginx/sites-available/default server { … rewrite ^/images/(.*)$ http://images.example.com/$1 redirect; … } You could change redirect to permanent at the end of the statement to make the redirection last forever.\nYou’ll need to restart Nginx for your changes to take effect.

There are many ways to use redirection, and there are a few different kinds to think about. Redirects are used when a website needs to send people who type in one address to a different one.\nAs you make content and manage servers, you will often need to send traffic from one place to another.

The DocumentRoot is a directory listed in the block of configuration for \u003cVirtualHost\u003e. This directory is intended to represent the various files, folders, and services on the file system that users access via HTTP. However, it is normal for administrators to provide HTTP access to a resource that is not located in the DocumentRoot on file system. For certain cases, although Apache may obey symbolic connections, this could be hard to sustain. It allows Apache to assign an Alias that links a place in the request to an alternate location.\nThis document describes how to manage resources on the file system using the Alias directive while still providing access through HTTP. In addition, this guide assumes that you have an Apache installation working and that you have access to change configuration files. If you have not installed Apache, you might want to find one of our installation guides for Apache or the installation guides for LAMP stacks. If you want a more comprehensive guide to Apache configuration, find the fundamentals of our Apache configuration and the layout of the Apache papers.","creating-aliases#Creating Aliases":"Virtual Host configurations usually specify a DocumentRoot which, by default, specifies a directory called public_html/ or public/. If the root document for the virtual host abc.com is/srv/www/abc.com/public_html/, then the file located at /srv/www/abc.com/public_html/index.htm will be returned by a request for http://www.abc.com/index.htm.\nIf the administrator were to retain the file system code/ resource at /srv/git/public/ but make it accessible at http://abc.com/code/,, an alias will be required. In this example this is accomplished:\nDocumentRoot /srv/www/abc.com/public_html/ Alias /code /srv/git/public Order allow,deny Allow from all Without the Alias instruction, a http://abc.com/code/ request will return the resources available in the /srv/www/abc.com/public_html/code/. folder. The Alias will therefore direct Apache to serve content from the directory /srv/git/public. The segment \u003cDirectory\u003e allows remote users to access the directory.\nThere are a variety of important factors to remember when using the Alias Directive:\nDirectory blocks need to be generated after Alias has been declared for the destination of Alias. This makes it possible to allow access to and otherwise regulate the actions of certain pieces. That would be /srv/git/public in the example above. In general, trailing slashes should be avoided in the Alias Directives. If the above read Alias /code/ /srv/git/public/ the request for http://abc.com/code, code, without a trailing slash, it will be served from the DocumentRoot. The Alias directives must be generated either in the root-level configuration of the server (e.g. httpd.conf) or in the \u003cVirtualHost\u003e configuration block. In addition to Alias, Apache provides for an AliasMatch Directive that provides similar functionality. AliasMatch includes an additional opportunity to alias a class of requests for a given resource to a place outside the DocumentRoot. Consider another fictitious abc.com virtual host configuration:\nDocumentRoot /srv/www/abc.com/public_html/ AliasMatch /code/projects/(.+) /srv/git/projects/$ Order allow,deny Allow from all In this example, resource requests for URLs such as http:/abc.com/code/projects/my_app and http:/abc.com/code/projects/my_app2 will be served in /srv/git/projects/my_app2 respectively. Nonetheless, http:/abc.com/code/projects will be accessed from /srv/www/abc.com/public html/code/projects/ instead of /srv/git/projects/ due to the /code/projects/(.+) trailing slash in the alias.\nAlthough the possible use case for Alias is quite limited, the feature is very powerful to maintain a stable and well-organized web server."},"title":"Managing Resources using Apache mod_alias"},"/docs/web-servers/nginx-enable-tls-or-https-connections/":{"data":{"":"\nThe Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is the successor to Transportation Layer Security (TLS).

Nonetheless, you will tell NGINX that port 443 for HTTPS connections should be listening instead of port 80. For further information, see the SSL module for NGINX docs.\n1. For example, below is a simple site configuration that works with the above-mentioned http block. This server block provides your site with IPv4 and IPv6 support, but you have no HTTP support only over HTTPS. In order to access your website, you need to type https:/ in the browser.\nIt is just a first step; without HSTS or by redirecting HTTP requests to port 443 you probably would not like to use this configuration.\nserver { listen ssl default_server; listen [::]:ssl default_server ; server_name abc.com www.abc.com; root /var/www/abc.com; } 2.

This is the best way to install because you can install the nginx package using your package manager. However, for distributions that supply binaries, you are going to run an older version of NGINX as opposed to the current stable or mainline version. Patches can also be slower to land in upstream distro repositories.\nA pre-built binary from NGINX Inc.’s repository. That is the way that sequence is built. It is still a simple installation process that just needs to be connected to your device and then configured as usual. The most beneficial approach is the traditional upstream setup with quicker updates and new releases than a Linux distribution. Compile time options are commonly different from NGINX binaries in distribution repositories and nginx -V can be used to display the built-in of your binary.\nCompiling from source. It is the most complex, but not yet impractical deployment approach after the NGINX documentation. Source code is always modified by patches and maintained on the newest stable or mainline updates, so construction can be automated easily. This is the most flexible installation method because any compiling options and flags you select can be included or skipped. For instance, one common reason why people compile their own NGINX build is that they can use a server with a newer OpenSSL version than their Linux distribution.","configuration-notes#Configuration Notes":"As the use of the NGINX web server has grown, NGINX, Inc. has worked to distance NGINX from configurations and terminology that were used in the past when trying to ease adoption for people already accustomed to Apache.\nIf you know Apache well, you will know that multiple site configurations are stored in /etc/apache/sites-available/, (so called virtual hosts in Apache terminology), which are symlinked to files inside /etc/apache/sites-enabled/. However, multiple NGINX guides and blog posts recommend the same settings. As you might expect, that lead to some confusion, with the hypothesis that NGINX uses the ../sites-available/ and ../sites-enabled/ and users of www-data regularly. That’s not the case.\nSure, it may. The NGINX packages of deposits in Debian and Ubuntu have modified their configuration for quite a while to that purpose, so it is definitely a working configuration to support sites that are stored in /sites-available/ and symlinked with /sites-enabled/. But, it’s unnecessary and the only one that does it is the Debian Linux family. Do not push Apache settings on NGINX.\nMultiple site configuration files can then be stored as an abc.com.conf, or abc.com.disabled in /etc/nginx/conf.d/. Do not add server blocks to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf directly, as your configuration is fairly straightforward. This file is intended to configure the server process rather than individual websites.\nThe NGINX method also acts as the ngnix user in the nginx community, so note when you change permissions to website folders.

Modern browsers have also taken steps to combat these attacks, but web servers may be irresponsibly configured.\nAt the other hand, if you completely disable gzip compression, you remove such vulnerabilities and use less CPU cycles at the cost of reducing the efficiency of the web. Different mitigations are possible on the server and the introduction of TLS 1.3 will contribute further to this. For now, the only way, unless you know what you are doing, is only to compress static site content like images, Text, and CSS.\nBelow is an example of how to use cat /etc/nginx/mime.types to display the mime forms available. If you want the gzip guidelines to extend to all sites supported by NGINX in the http domain, it is better to use them for specific sites and content types only in the server domain.\ngzip on; gzip_types text/html text/plain text/css image/*; If NGINX serves many websites, some use SSl / TLS and some don’t, an example would look as in the following example.

Rewrite a URL is a server-side operation which can serve contents from a position of a file system that does not exactly suit the client’s request. It could be helpful to enhance the readability of URLs by search engines and users, or to upgrade tools when the layout of your site changes.\nBefore You Begin 1. This guide assumes that you have followed our Getting Started and Securing Your Server guides, and that you have already configured your Apache installation. If you haven’t, please refer to our Apache guides or LAMP stack guides.\n2. We’re going to change Apache configuration files in this guide so make sure you have the correct permissions to do so.\n3. Update your system.\nsudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt-get upgrade Rewrite URLs In a \u003cDirectory\u003e block (usually a virtual host file) or a .htaccess file, enable mod rewrite:\nRewriteEngine on You can set up several separate rules for rewrite. Such rules include a template comparable by the server against incoming requests. If a request fits a pattern for rewrite, the server will change the request as defined in the rule and will process the request. Here is an example of a law on rewrite:\nRewriteRule ^post-id/([0-9]+)$ /posts/$1.html Let’s explain this rule: the first string is a pattern to match incoming requests. The second string specifies the actual files that are to be served. Use regular expression syntax to rewrite patterns. The ^ defines the beginning of the string, and the $defines the end of the string, which means that the rewrite engine will not rewrite strings that match only part of the pattern.\nThe string rewrites all URLs specifying paths beginning with /post-id/ and containing one or more numbers (e.g. [0-9]+) in the /posts/ directory, providing a corresponding .html file. The parenthetical term or terms in the pattern define a variable that is passed as $1, $2, $3 and so on to the second string, depending on how many parentheticals are given in the first string.\nYou can build and implement several rewrite rules, then sequentially implement those rules. The order in which you define RewriteRules will affect the rules match.\nOptionally, you can insert a directive on RewriteBase to change the rewrite rules actions. Suppose we:\nThe /srv/www/abc.com/public html/ directory defines such directives. Some users make a request in the form http:/abc.com/post-id/200, where 200 may be more than one digit in number. Some users send requests in the http:/abc.com/page/title-of-page type, where “page title” may represent any string of characters. The files are stored on the /srv/www/abc.com/public html/objects/ directory and fit the requested object in name, but have an extension of .html. RewriteEngine on RewriteBase /objects RewriteRule ^post-id/([0-9]+)$ $1.html RewriteRule ^page/([^/]+)$ $1.html The rewrite rules outlined above will apply for:\nhttp:/abc.com/post-id/200/ and the /srv/www/abc.com/public html/ objects/200.html file http:/abc.com/page/free-toast/ and support the /srv/abc.com/public html/objects/free-toast.html file This is useful if the file system positions don’t match the URLs as requested by the client. This is also particularly useful when a single file, for example index.php, dynamically generates all requests.\nRewrite URLs Under Specific Conditions You can set the conditions under which a RewriteRule is to be used with the parameter RewriteCond. Let us take the following example from the WordPress application’s default rewrite rules:\nRewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /index.php [L] In this example, all requests that begin with the top level of the context are affected by the rewrite rules. This is defined in the directive RewriteBase /. The context is determined by where the rewrite rules are specified in the virtual host, directory block, or .htaccess file.\nThe statements in RewriteCond instruct Apache to enforce only the rule that follows them if their requirements are fulfilled. The requested file name in the above example does not need to match an existing file on the file system! (-f) and does not match an existing directory on the file system! (-d).\nIf both conditions are true and there is no file or directory that matches the request, Apache will apply the rewrite rule. For example, if the user asks for http:/abc.com/? Post=123 or http:/abc.com/post/123 will the server return the result for index.php? Post=123 or the.php/post/123 index, respectively.\nMultiple RewriteCond is connected to logical AND operators in such a way that all conditions are true in order for the RewriteRule to apply to that request. You may also add a [OR] statement at the end of the RewriteCond directive to add a list of conditions to the logical OR and create a number of possible conditions where the request is rewritten by a single RewriteRule. For more information on rewrite conditions, see the Apache mod rewrite documentation.\nRedirection Codes in mod_rewrite Finally, there are a number of codes that you can add to the RewriteRule that change the behavior of the rewrite. Rewrite Rule in the previous example. /index.php [L], we used the [L] option that stands for “last rule.” This prevents Apache from applying any additional rewrite rules to that rule. There are a few common options:\nF tells the client that the URL is forbidden to respond with HTTP code 403. N forces mod rewrite to restart the rewrite process, and enables multi-stage rewrite. R informs the client that the requested page has passed, with the temporary redirection of HTTP code 302. Using \"R=301\" when the page has relocated permanently. You may also specify multiple options at the end of a RewriteRule separating them with commas: [L,R=301]\nThankyou..","rewrite-urls#Rewrite URLs":"","rewrite-urls-under-specific-conditions#Rewrite URLs Under Specific Conditions":""},"title":"Rewrite URLs using mod_rewrite and Apache"},"/docs/web-servers/rule-based-access-control-for-apache/":{"data":{"":"\nApache provides a set of tools that allow administrators to manage server-provided access to specific resources. You can already know about authentication-based access controls, which allow visitors to authenticate the server before accessing resources.\nThe rule-based access control implemented by Apache allows you to determine which visitors have access to certain resources at a very granular level. You may build rules that block a specified set of IPs from your web server, or access a particular resource, or even just access a certain virtual host.\nThe most fundamental application of rule-based access control is to set firm limits on which resources are accessible through network link. The Web server refuses all users access to all files on the network in the default Apache configuration. Instead, Apache helps administrators to control unique tools.\nAdditional uses for such access rules include blocking unique IP ranges that have been responsible for malicious traffic and restricting “internal users” access to a specified resource or collection of resources, among a variety of other possibilities.\nAdditional uses for these access rules include blocking specific IP ranges that were responsible for malicious traffic and limiting access to a given resource or set of resources to “internal users” among a number of other options.","additional-access-control-rules#Additional Access Control Rules":"By changing and broadening the example above, you may define granular access control rules for your resources. The notes and suggestions below provide some insight into some of the more advanced features that such access control systems can provide.","advanced-access-control#Advanced Access Control":"Although IP address is by far the simplest way to use these access control rules to manage access, Apache offers a variety of additional methods.\nFirstly, Apache allows administrators to require or deny access based on the requester’s hostname. This forces Apache to look up the hostname running the request to do a reverse DNS (rDNS) lookup and then allow or refuse access based on that information. Consider the following example:\nOrder Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow from hostname.abc.com In this setup, Apache only allows requests from the hostname.abc.com machine with valid rDNS to access the resource.\nSecondly, you can create access rules in the HTTP session around environment variables. This enables you to allow and deny access to resources on the basis of variables such as browser (user agent) and referrer. Take, for example, the following:\nSetEnvIf Referer searchenginez.com search_traffic Order Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow from env=search_traffic This access control rule works with mod_setenvif of Apache. First, if a request reference matches searchenginez.com the search_traffic environment variable is set. Next, all hosts are denied resource access. Finally, requests with the search_traffic environment variable set allow access to the resource. For more information on setting and using environment variables, please review the official Apache documentation for mod_setenvif.\nThankyou..","controlling-access-for-a-range-of-ips#Controlling Access for a Range of IPs":"Apache allows this with the following syntax if you want to manage access for a number of IP addresses and not for a single address:\nOrder Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow from 192.Allow from 10 The statements above provide for all addresses starting with 192.168 and 10. Such IP ranges are usually reserved for local networking, and are not adresses that can be routed publicly. If used, certain access control regulations can only permit traffic on the network from “local sources.”\nHere is an additional example of an access rule:\nOrder Allow,Deny Allow from all Deny from 185.201.1 This rule requires access to the provided resource for all, and then refuses access to all IP addresses beginning with 185.201.1. That statement will include all traffic originating from the 185.201.1.0 to 185.201.1.255 IP address range.\nBe very careful that these directives are placed in the proper sense when developing access control rules, especially those that use the Allow from all directives.","examples-of-rule-based-access-control#Examples of Rule Based Access Control":"You may want to consult our Apache Configuration Structure Guide to see a number of examples of these directives in practice.\nHere is an example of a basic rule:\nOrder Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow from 192.168.2.101 To analyze this in simpler terms:\nThe regulation Order Deny, Allow inform the web server that “Deny” rules should be processed prior to Allow rules.

After reaching the mark, the child cycle dies. The child cycle shall never expire if set to 0. With this the recommended value is a few thousand, to prevent memory leakage.

The queue size is dependent on directive ListenBacklog. If MaxRequestWorkers is set too low, connections will ultimately be sent time-out to the queue; but, if set too high, this will cause the memory to swap. If that value is increased past 256, the value of ServerLimit must be increased as well.\nOne way to determine the best value for this is to divide the amount of RAM each Apache process uses by the available amount of RAM, leaving some space for other processes.

The advantage of this value is that it can take an empty thread when a request comes in; should a thread not be available, Apache will need to spawn a new kid, take up resources and prolong the time it takes for the request to go through.

However, for ease of use, most modules have their own configuration files and can be enabled and disabled via command line rather than by editing the configuration file.","create-virtual-host-directories#Create Virtual Host Directories":"Whether you are using simple-vhost or evhost, before lighttpd can serve content, you need to create directories. Once you have installed the necessary instructions, build the necessary directories to replace abc.com with your name of domain:\nmkdir -p /var/www/html/abc .com/htdocs/ The following command generates two additional virtual hosts for the top-level fields.net and.org:\nmkdir -p /var/www/html/{abc.net/htdocs, abc.org/htdocs} The following command creates two additional virtual hosts from the evhost abc for the subdomains:\nmkdir -p /var/www/html/{abcSub/htdocs,abcSub2/htdocs} ","enable-and-disable-modules-via-command-line#Enable and Disable Modules via Command Line":"You may want to allow and disable modules via the command line for easy use. Lighttpd provides a simple way to do this so that each time a new module is needed the configuration must not be edited.\nRun light-enabled-mod from the command line to see the list of modules available, a list of modules already enabled, and a prompt to enable a module. This can be done in one line as well. To activate the authentication module, for example:\nlighty-enable-mod auth This command creates a symbolic connection to the /etc/ lighttpd/conf-enabled configuration file of the module read in the main configuration file. Check for the .conf file in /etc/lighttpd/conf-available to change the configuration of a particular module.\nThere are many other modules in separate Ubuntu packages. Some good stuff are:\nlighttpd-mod-mysql-vhost-Uses MySQL database to control virtual hosts. This module works well when a large number of virtual hosts are managed. lighttpd-mod-webdav Apache supports WebDAV extensions for distributed Apache content authoring lighttpd-mod-magnet Checks the request management module When these packages are mounted, you can enable them with light-enable-mod.\nRestart lighttpd to load changes:\nsystemctl restart lighttpd.service ","install-lighttpd#Install Lighttpd":"Load server from the list of Ubuntu packages:\napt-get install lighttpd Upon deployment, make sure the server is running and activated. Visit http:/198.51.100.10:80 and your IP address will be replaced by 198.51.100.10. If you set up lighttpd for testing on an alternate port, please replace 80 with this version. You will see a lighttpd placeholder page containing some important information:\nConfiguration files in /etc/lighttpd are stored. The “DocumentRoot” (which includes all HTML files) is located in the /var/www directory by default. You should customize this later. Ubuntu provides help scripts for allowing and deactivating server modules without editing the config file directly: light-enable-mod and light-disable-mod. ","run-scripts-with-fastcgi#Run Scripts with FastCGI":"You can execute these scripts with FastCGI, if you need your web server to execute dynamic content. In order to run a script, FastCGI outputs the Web server interpreter rather than run the “inside” scripts on the Web server. This is in contrast to approaches such as mod perl, mod python, and mod php, but in high-traffic circumstances this way is often more effective.\nTo set up FastCGI, make sure that an interpreter for your chosen language is installed on your system:\nTo install Python:\napt-get install python To install Ruby:\napt-get install ruby To install PHP 7 for CGI interfaces\napt-get install php7.0-cgi Perl version 5.22.1 is included by default in Ubuntu 16.04. You will also need to install and set up a database system depending on the program you plan to run.\nOn the basis of file extensions that can be sent to individual managers, Lighttpd sends CGI requests to CGI managers. You can also submit requests for an extension to several servers and lighttpd loads these FastCGI connections automatically.\nInstalling a php7.0-cgi package and allowing FastCGI with light-enable-mod quickcgi-php for instance, configures the standard FastCGI handler in /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled/15-fastcgi-php.conf. Although the handler probably needs to be changed, the default settings are an effective example:\nfastcgi.server += ( \".php\" =\u003e (( \"bin-path\" =\u003e \"/usr/bin/php-cgi\", \"socket\" =\u003e \"/var/run/lighttpd/php.socket\", \"max-procs\" =\u003e 1, \"bin-environment\" =\u003e ( \"PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN\" =\u003e \"4\", \"PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS\" =\u003e \"10000\" ), \"bin-copy-environment\" =\u003e ( \"PATH\", \"SHELL\", \"USER\" ), \"broken-scriptfilename\" =\u003e \"enable\" )) ) Add the following entry to your configuration file to map more than one file extension to a single FastCGI handler:\nfastcgi.map-extensions = ( \".[ALT-EXTENSION]\" =\u003e \".[EXTENSION]\" ) ","things-to-keep-in-mind#Things to Keep in Mind":"Though lighttpd is an efficient and capable web server, its behavior has two warnings:\nServer side does not function in lighttpd in the same way as in Apache’s mod ssi, which allows you to dynamically insert content from one file into another. Even though this is an effective way to assemble content quickly, lighttpd ’s handling of the script via SSI is not a recommended workflow. See project documentation for lighttpd on mod ssi.\nBecause of how FastCGI works, the operation of lighttpd web applications requires extra configuration, particularly for users who use web server-embedded interpreters (e.g. mod perl, mod python, mod php). See the lighttpd project documentation on optimizing FastCGI output for more detail.\nThankyou..","virtual-host-setup-with-enhanced-vhost#Virtual Host Setup with Enhanced Vhost":"Enhanced virtual hosting works somewhat different from Simple by building a document root based on a wildcard pattern. Before beginning, make sure all other virtual hosting modules are disabled.\nTo allow the enhanced virtual hosting module, run the following command: ``` lighty-enable-mod evhost 2. Restart lighttpd to load the configuration changes: ``` systemctl restart lighttpd.service You must modify /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/10-evhost.conf to achieve the same directory structure by evhost as with simple-vhost above: evhost.path-pattern = \"/var/www/html/%0/htdocs/\" 4. Modify the server.document-root configuration file in the main lighttpd:\nserver.document-root = \"/var/www/html/abc.com/htdocs\" When abc.com is requested and /var/www/html/abc.com/htdocs/ is found, the configuration set to Steps 3 and 4 is the root of the document when you send requests. The 0 percent of the pattern means that a request will be verified for domain and Top Level Domain (TLD) called host files. The.document-root server directive defines a default host used when there is no corresponding directory.\n5. Restart lighttpd to load the configuration changes:\nsystemctl restart lighttpd.service The convention on naming these virtual hosts is derived from the domain names. Take an example of the following web address: http:/abcSub2.abcA.com/ We read domain names from top level on the right to bottom level on the left. Therefore, com is the TLD, abc A is the domain, abcSub is subdomain 1 and abcSub2 is the subdomain 2.\nTo change the lighttpd format of the host directory, define the pattern to the directory in which the content lives. The table below shows the host directory format used for each pattern as root document. It also shows which host file will be used to serve content, with an example request from the above URL:","virtual-host-setup-with-simple-vhost#Virtual Host Setup with Simple Vhost":"This segment covers a basic virtual hosting setup. The Simple Vhost module lets you set virtual hosts in a user defined directory named for the domains below a root server with their respective document roots. Make sure all other virtual hosting modules are disabled before continuing.\nStart by allowing simple-vhost: ``` lighty-enable-mod simple-vhost 2. Restart lighttpd to load your changes: ``` systemctl restart lighttpd.service Modify the following settings in your /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/10-simple-vhost.conf file: simple-vhost.server-root = \"/var/www/html\" simple-vhost.document-root = \"htdocs\" simple-vhost.default-host = \"abc.com\" The server root specifies the base directory for all host directories.\nThe document-root determines the subdirectory in which the pages to be served are located. In some Apache configurations, this is similar to the public html directory, but in the above configuration it is called htdocs.\nWhen lighttpd receives a request and is unable to find a compatible directory, the content is served from the default host.\nRequests are tested in the above configuration for existing directory names within /var/www/html. If a directory exists which matches the requested domain, the result is served by the respective htdocs. If it does not exist, content from htdocs is served in the default host directory.\nIn order to explain this definition, presume that /var / www / html only contains the abcA.com and abc.com directories, both of which contain content htdocs folders:\nWhen an application for an abcA.com URL is made, the content of /var/www/html/abcA.com / htdocs is served. When a request is made for a server URL that does not have a directory, contents will be served with /var/www/html/abc.com/htdocs as abc.com is the default host. Build host directories for each subdome in the same way for subdomains. For example , in order to use abcSub as a subdomain of abc A.com, create an abcSub. abc A.com directory with a content htdocs directory. Make sure that any subdomains you want to use are added to DNS records.\n4. Restart the web server again to reload changes:\nsystemctl restart lighttpd.service ","virtual-hosting-best-practices#Virtual Hosting Best Practices":"The way you set up virtual hosting on your web server depends, what sites you host, how many domains you traffic, and how many workflows you run. We suggest that you host all of your domains into a single directory (e.g. /var/www/html) and connect the directories symbolically to useful locations.\nFor example, you can build a series of user accounts for the “blog editor.” You can then connect the document root of each domain to a folder in the editor’s home folder. For the abc-user user account that manages the abc.com website:\nln -s /home/abc-user/abc.com/ /var/www/html/abc.com You may also use symbolic connections to host the same files for many essentially host domains. For example , in order to see abc .org for example in the files of abc .com, build the following link:\nln -s /var/www/html/ abc .org/ /var/www/html/ abc .com No matter what you decide, we advise you to build a structured method to manage virtual hosting to simplify any device modifications."},"title":"Use lighttpd Web Server in Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus)"},"/docs/web-servers/use-nginx-as-a-reverse-proxy-2/":{"data":{"":"","#":"\nWhat is a Reverse Proxy?

Safe Mode enables users to debug and find the root cause of a fault.\nIn safe mode, an operating system has reduced functionality; however, the process of isolating problems is facilitated by the fact that many non-essential components, such as sound, are disabled. An installation that will only boot into safe mode typically has a significant issue, such as disc corruption or the installation of software with improper configuration, which prevents the operating system from successfully booting into its normal operating mode and allowing the user to use the computer as intended.\nA user is normally granted access to utility and diagnostic programs when operating in safe mode. This enables the user to investigate and resolve issues that prevent the operating system from functioning normally. The functionality of the system is not meant to be used while in safe mode, and user access to features is severely restricted.\nYou have to login into your window server.\nStep 1.
